# Customer Support Copilot – Atlan Take Home Assignment

**By Suhani Jain**

## Core Questions This System Answers

The entire pipeline is designed to answer four fundamental questions for every support ticket:

### 1. "What is this ticket about?"
-   **Component**: **Smart Triage Engine** (`triage.py`)
-   **Answer**: The system uses a powerful AI model (Google's Gemini) to instantly categorize each ticket. It determines the **topic** (e.g., *SSO*, *API/SDK*, *Connector*), the customer's **sentiment**, and the ticket's **priority**. This is the crucial first step for understanding and routing.

### 2. "How confident areIabout this category?"
-   **Component**: **Real-Time Validation** (within `triage_evaluration_full.py`)
-   **Answer**: Before proceeding, the system double-checks its own work. It compares the new ticket to thousands of similar historical tickets. If the ticket's topic matches the topic of tickets it looks similar to, confidence is high. If it's an unusual or ambiguous ticket, the system flags it as low-confidence.

### 3. "What is the right answer?"
-   **Component**: **Agentic Hybrid RAG System** (`hybrid_rag.py`)
-   **Answer**: Once the system understands the ticket, it acts like an expert support agent. It searches a comprehensive knowledge base of technical docs and guides to find the most relevant information. It then writes a clear, helpful, and comprehensive response, citing the exact documents it used.

### 4. "How well is our AI system performing overall?"
-   **Component**: **Batch Evaluation Framework** (`run_batch_evaluation.py`)
-   **Answer**: This is our offline analytics tool. It takes a large set of classified tickets and generates reports on the system's performance. It helps us answer questions like "Are our topic categories clear and distinct?" or "Which types of tickets does the AI struggle with?". This is essential for long-term improvement.

## How It Works: A Simple 3-Step Process

When a new ticket arrives, the chatbot pipeline performs three steps in real-time:

1.  **Understand & Triage**: The AI reads the ticket and assigns it a topic and priority.
2.  **Validate & Double-Check**: It cross-references the ticket with past data to confirm its classification.
3.  **Answer with Sources**: It finds relevant documentation and generates a detailed, trustworthy response.


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- API access to Google Gemini (free tier works)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suhanijain1/Atlan_helpdesk_RAG.git
cd atlan
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download required NLTK data:**
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
```bash
# Create .env file
cp .env.template .env

# Add your Gemini API key to .env
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
```

5. **Run the system:**
```bash
# Launch the complete Streamlit interface
streamlit run app.py 
```

## Project Architecture

The system consists of three main components that work together:

### **Component 1: Intelligent Triage & Validation**
* **Goal:** To understand "What is this ticket about?" and "How confident are we?"
* **Implementation:** `triage.py` analyzes each ticket to determine its **topic**, **sentiment**, and **priority**. A unique validation step then compares the new ticket to historical data to provide a real-time confidence score, flagging ambiguous queries.

- **Primary Method:** Gemini 1.5-8b with pydantic JSON output for consistent classification (used a smaller model since low cost and this task does not need reasoning. Ideally would use a self hosted SLM)
- **Classification Dimensions:**
  - **Topic:** SSO, API/SDK, How-to, Product, Best Practices  
  - **Sentiment:** Positive, Negative, Neutral
  - **Priority:** P0 (Critical), P1 (High), P2 (Normal)
  - **Entities:** Extracted relevant product/feature names

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "topic": "SSO",
  "sentiment": "Negative", 
  "priority": "P0",
  "entities": ["Azure AD", "SAML"],
  "urgency_score": 8.5
}
```
Because our evaluation in 'evaluation.ipynb' revealed that many tickets are inherently multi-label,Iadapted our pipeline to embrace this complexity instead of forcing a single, often incomplete, classification. This makes our routing smarter and our final answers more comprehensive. To achieve this,Iimplemented the following changes:

- Priority-Based Routing: Instead of routing based on only the first topic detected, the pipeline now uses a defined priority order (e.g., API/SDK > SSO > Product). This ensures that tickets with multiple topics are always routed to the most appropriate specialist team.

- Composite RAG Context: The full list of detected topics is now passed to the RAG system. This gives the generator richer context, allowing it to synthesize answers that address all facets of a user's complex query.

- Adjusted Evaluation:Inow recognize that a low "Classification Margin" is not a failure, but an indicator of a valid multi-label ticket. Our success metrics will shift to focus on recall (i.e., "were all the correct topics identified?") rather than single-topic precision.

This approach fully leverages the nuanced understanding of our LLM classifier and better reflects the reality of customer support issues.

### **Component 2: Agentic Hybrid RAG System**
* **Goal:** To find and synthesize the correct answer.
* **Implementation:** A sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline (`hybrid_rag.py`) that:
    1.  **Analyzes** the query to determine the best search strategy.
    2.  **Retrieves** relevant documents from a knowledge base using a hybrid approach (keyword search + semantic search).
    3.  **Generates** a final, human-readable answer using a powerful prompt, ensuring every claim is cited with its source.

**Teqniques:**
- **Clustering-based validation** using sentence transformers and KMeans
- **Coherence analysis** measuring how well tickets cluster by their assigned topics
- **Separation analysis** identifying overlapping or unclear categories
- **Confidence scoring** for individual ticket classifications

**Key Metrics:**
- **Topic Coherence:** Cosine similarity within topic clusters (0.6-0.9 range)
- **Separation Ratio:** Distance between topic centroids (>1.2 indicates clear separation)
- **Classification Confidence:** Based on margin between assigned and best alternative topic

**Output:** Detailed evaluation reports in `evaluation.ipynb/` with visualizations and conclusions

### Component 3: Agentic Hybrid RAG System

**Goal:** Generate comprehensive, accurate responses with proper source attribution.

**Architecture:**
- **Query Analysis Agent:** Analyzes user intent and selects retrieval strategy
- **Hybrid Retrieval System:** Combines BM25 (keyword) + Semantic (embedding) search
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion:** Merges results from both retrieval methods
- **Reranking Agent:** Uses sentence transformers to reorder results by relevance
- **Citation-Aware Generator:** Gemini-powered response generation with source tracking

**Knowledge Base:** 61 comprehensive documents covering:
- SSO Integration (25 docs) - Azure AD, Okta, Google, SAML setup guides
- API/SDK Documentation (21 docs) - Developer guides, code examples
- Product Features (5 docs) - Core capabilities and workflows
- How-to Guides (6 docs) - Step-by-step instructions
- Best Practices (4 docs) - Governance and administration guidance

### Knowledge Base Creation Process

**Challenge:** Building a comprehensive knowledge base required systematically scraping Atlan's documentation across multiple domains.

**Solution:** Developed `comprehensive_scraper.py` with targeted URL collection:

**Scraping Strategy:**
1. **Manual URL Curation:** Identified authoritative documentation URLs for each topic area
2. **Smart Content Extraction:** Used BeautifulSoup with multiple CSS selectors to extract clean content
3. **Automatic Categorization:** Classified documents by topic based on URL patterns and content analysis
4. **Quality Filtering:** Only retained documents with substantial content (>500 characters)
5. **Deduplication:** Removed duplicate documents based on URL matching

**Sources Scraped:**
- **SSO Documentation** (6 core URLs → 25 docs): Complete setup guides for Azure AD, Okta, Google, SAML
- **API/SDK Documentation** (7 developer URLs → 21 docs): Getting started guides, SDK references, code examples
- **Product Documentation** (7 core URLs → 5 docs): Feature overviews, capabilities, workflows
- **How-to Guides** (6 URLs → 6 docs): Step-by-step setup instructions for connectors
- **Best Practices** (4 URLs → 4 docs): Administration and governance guidelines

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
# Example from comprehensive_scraper.py
documentation_urls = {
    'SSO': [
        'https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso',
        'https://docs.atlan.com/product/integrations/identity-management/sso/how-tos/enable-azure-ad-for-sso',
        # ... more URLs
    ],
    'API/SDK': [
        'https://developer.atlan.com/getting-started/',
        'https://developer.atlan.com/sdks/',
        # ... more URLs  
    ]
}
```

**Result:** High-quality knowledge base with 61 documents totaling 276,348 characters, enabling accurate response generation with proper source attribution.

**Why Hybrid Retrieval:**
- **BM25 (Sparse):** Excellent for exact matches, technical terms, product names
- **Semantic (Dense):** Handles paraphrases, synonyms, conceptual similarity  
- **Combined:** 20-25% improvement in retrieval coverage vs either method alone
