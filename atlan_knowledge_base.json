To the right of each Atlan group listed: Under the SSO Groups column, type the name of the corresponding group in your custom IdP to map to the Atlan group on that row - for example, Data Engineering , Business Analysts , and so on. You will need to provide each custom IdP group with access to Atlan. Click the Save button on that row. As each user signs up to Atlan, they will be automatically assigned groups in Atlan based on these mappings! 🎉 Did you know? Once you've configured group mapping, you can add the mapped groups to a persona or purpose to auto-assign relevant permissions to users as they sign up in Atlan.

    "content": "Get Started Core Concepts Authentication and authorization On this page Authentication and authorization Atlan supports the following authentication methods: Basic authentication ​ Atlan initially comes with basic or username-password authentication. Admins can invite new users to log into Atlan. When a new user opens the invitation link, they will be able to set up their user profile, including username and password. However, Atlan does not recommend using basic authentication. Instead, admins should configure and enforce SSO authentication . SSO authentication ​ SSO using SAML 2.0 ​ Atlan supports single sign-on (SSO), allowing admins to configure SSO authentication. Atlan currently supports the following SSO providers: Azure AD Google JumpCloud Okta OneLogin Custom IdP SSO using SCIM ​ System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) provisioning works in combination with SSO. Atlan currently supports SCIM provisioning for the following SSO providers: Azure AD Okta Authorization ​ Role-based access control (RBAC) ​ Atlan implements role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users have the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks. Access rights are assigned based on roles, and users are granted permissions according to their responsibilities. A system owner or an authorized party must approve any additional permissions. Atlan adheres to the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users are only granted the level of access necessary to perform their job functions. User access review (UAR) ​ Atlan recommends that admins perform access reviews of users, admins, and service accounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that appropriate access levels are maintained. Access reviews should also be documented. Identity and access management ​ For centralized management of groups and users, Atlan uses granular access policies . Admins can define policies to control both which actions a user can take and against which assets. These can be as broad as entire databases down to individual columns. Organizations can even build policies based on asset classification. This opens up the ability to restrict access to sensitive data like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) - an essential feature in the GDPR era. Atlan denies access by default , and explicit denials override any grants . You can even deny admin users access to assets, if you want. Roles ​ You must assign every user in Atlan a user role . These control basic levels of access. Groups ​ You can also add users to groups . Groups provide a more maintainable mechanism for applying access controls. Policies ​ You can define access policies for both users and groups. Through these policies you can restrict which users can take which actions on which assets. For example, you can set up tags such as PII and apply this to data assets like tables. You can also configure the tag to propagate downstream to any columns or tables created from them. You can then define access controls based on these tags to restrict access to tagged assets. If Atlan propagates tags for you to derived assets, the access control is automatically applied to those derived assets as well.

Setting up Retrieving metadata What is an asset? When you know the asset When you need to find it first Updating metadata Importance of identifiers Limit to changes only Bulk changes Where to go from here An introductory walkthrough ¶ Atlan University You might also like our Atlan Platform Essentials certification . Not sure where to start? Allow us to introduce Atlan development through example. 1 Setting up ¶ We strongly recommend using one of our SDKs to simplify the development process. As a first step, set one up: Java Python Kotlin Go The SDK is available on Maven Central , ready to be included in your project: build.gradle.kts repositories { mavenCentral () } dependencies { implementation ( \"com.atlan:atlan-java:+\" ) // (1) testRuntimeOnly ( \"ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.11\" ) // (2) } Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include logback as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out). Provide two values to create an Atlan client: AtlanLiveTest.java 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 import com.atlan.AtlanClient ; public class AtlanLiveTest { public static void main ( String [] args ) { try ( AtlanClient client = new AtlanClient ( \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , // (1) \"...\" ) // (2) ) { // (3) } } } Provide your Atlan tenant URL as the first parameter. You can also read the value from an environment variable, if you leave out both parameters. Provide your API token as the second parameter. You can also read the value from another environment variable, by leaving out this parameter. You can then start writing some actual code to run within a static main method. (We'll show some examples of this further below.) Once the block is complete, any resources held by the client (i.e. for caching) will be automatically released. Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. The SDK is available on PyPI . You can use pip to install it as follows: Install the SDK pip install pyatlan Provide two values to create an Atlan client: atlan_live_test.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient ( base_url = \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , # (1) api_key = \"...\" # (2) ) Provide your Atlan tenant URL to the base_url parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .) Provide your API token to the api_key parameter. (You can also do this through environment variables .) Set up logging for SDK You can also checkout to the advanced configuration section of the SDK to learn about how to set up logging. The SDK is available on Maven Central , ready to be included in your project: build.gradle.kts repositories { mavenCentral () } dependencies { implementation ( \"com.atlan:atlan-java:+\" ) // (1) implementation ( \"io.github.microutils:kotlin-logging-jvm:3.0.5\" ) // (2) implementation ( \"org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.7\" ) } Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include slf4j-simple as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out), along with the kotlin-logging-jvm microutil. Provide two values to create an Atlan client: AtlanLiveTest.kt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 import com.atlan.AtlanClient; fun main () { AtlanClient ( \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , // (1) \"...\" // (2) ). use { client -> // (3) } } Provide your Atlan tenant URL as the first parameter. You can also read the value from an environment variable, if you leave out both parameters. Provide your API token as the second parameter. You can also read the value from another environment variable, by leaving out this parameter. You ",

Obtain the SDK ¶ The SDK is available on Maven Central, ready to be included in your project: Gradle Maven build.gradle repositories { mavenCentral () } dependencies { implementation \"com.atlan:atlan-java:+\" // (1) testRuntimeOnly 'ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.11' // (2) } Include the latest version of the Java SDK in your project as a dependency. You can also give a specific version instead of the + , if you'd like. The Java SDK uses slf4j for logging purposes. You can include logback as a simple binding mechanism to send any logging information out to your console (standard out), at INFO -level or above. pom.xml <dependency> <groupId> com.atlan </groupId> <artifactId> atlan-java </artifactId> <version> ${atlan.version} </version> </dependency> Configure the SDK ¶ There are two ways to configure the SDK: Using environment variables ¶ ATLAN_API_KEY should be given your Atlan API token , for authentication ( don't forget to assign one or more personas to the API token to give access to existing assets! ) ATLAN_BASE_URL should be given your Atlan URL (for example, https://tenant.atlan.com ) Here's an example of setting those environment variables: Set environment variables export ATLAN_BASE_URL=https://tenant.atlan.com export ATLAN_API_KEY=\"...\" AtlanLiveTest.java 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 import com.atlan.AtlanClient ; public class AtlanLiveTest { public static void main ( String [] args ) { try ( AtlanClient client = new AtlanClient ()) { // Do something with the client } } } On client creation ¶ If you prefer to not use environment variables, you can do the following: AtlanLiveTest.java 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 import com.atlan.AtlanClient ; public class AtlanLiveTest { public static void main ( String [] args ) { try ( AtlanClient client = new AtlanClient ( \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , \"...\" ) ) { // Do something with the client } } } Careful not to expose your API token! We generally discourage including your API token directly in your code, in case you accidentally commit it into a (public) version control system. But it's your choice exactly how you manage the API token and including it for use within the client. (Note that you can also explicity provide only the tenant URL, and the constructor will look for only the API key through an environment variable.) That's it — once these are set you can start using your SDK to make live calls against your Atlan instance! 🎉 What's next? ¶ Delve into more detailed examples: Common tasks Common operations on assets, that are available across all assets.

Obtain the SDK ¶ The SDK is currently available on pypi . You can use pip to install it as follows: Install the SDK pip install pyatlan Configure the SDK ¶ There are two ways to configure the SDK: Using environment variables ¶ ATLAN_API_KEY should be given your Atlan API token , for authentication ( don't forget to assign one or more personas to the API token to give access to existing assets! ) ATLAN_BASE_URL should be given your Atlan URL (for example, https://tenant.atlan.com ) Here's an example of setting those environment variables: Set environment variables export ATLAN_BASE_URL=https://tenant.atlan.com export ATLAN_API_KEY=\"...\" atlan_live_test.py 1 2 3 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient () On client creation ¶ If you prefer to not use environment variables, you can do the following: atlan_live_test.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient ( base_url = \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , api_key = \"...\" ) Careful not to expose your API token! We generally discourage including your API token directly in your code, in case you accidentally commit it into a (public) version control system. But it's your choice exactly how you manage the API token and including it for use within the client. (optional) Want to create a client using an API token GUID? In some scenarios, you may not want to expose the entire API token or manage environment variables. Instead, you can provide the GUID of the API token, and the SDK will internally fetch the actual access token. When to use this approach: Building apps that use the SDK where token security is a concern When you want to avoid exposing full API tokens in your configuration For containerized applications that need secure token management Prerequisites: Before using this approach, ensure your Argo template is configured with CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET : Argo template configuration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 container : image : ghcr.io/atlanhq/designation-based-group-provisioning:1.0.2 imagePullPolicy : IfNotPresent env : - name : CLIENT_ID valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : \"argo-client-creds\" key : \"login\" - name : CLIENT_SECRET valueFrom : secretKeyRef : name : \"argo-client-creds\" key : \"password\" Python 7.1.4 Creating a client with API token GUID 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import FluentSearch from pyatlan.model.query import CompoundQuery from pyatlan.model.assets import AtlasGlossary # Initialize client using API token GUID token_client = AtlanClient . from_token_guid ( guid = \"c5e249d7-abcc-4ad5-87a1-831d7b810df4\" # (1) ) # Perform operations with the client (requires appropriate permissions) results = ( FluentSearch () . where ( CompoundQuery . active_assets ()) . where ( CompoundQuery . asset_type ( AtlasGlossary )) . page_size ( 100 ) . execute ( client = token_client ) ) assert results and results . count >= 1 print ( f \"Found { results . count } glossary assets\" ) Create client from token GUID : Use AtlanClient.from_token_guid() to create a client using the GUID of an API token.

Obtain the SDK Configure the SDK Using environment variables On client creation What's next? Error-handling Advanced configuration Logging Go SDK ¶ Obtain the SDK ¶ Pre-release state The Go SDK is currently in a pre-release, experimental state. While in this state, we reserve the right to make any changes to it (including breaking changes) without worrying about backwards compatibility, semantic versioning, and so on. If you are eager to experiment with it, it is available on GitHub . You can use Go dependencies to install it directly from there. We welcome your feedback during the pre-release, but cannot commit to any specific revisions or timelines at this point in time. Configure the SDK ¶ There are two ways to configure the SDK: Using environment variables ¶ ATLAN_API_KEY should be given your Atlan API token , for authentication ( don't forget to assign one or more personas to the API token to give access to existing assets! ) ATLAN_BASE_URL should be given your Atlan URL (for example, https://tenant.atlan.com ) Here's an example of setting those environment variables: Set environment variables export ATLAN_BASE_URL=https://tenant.atlan.com export ATLAN_API_KEY=\"...\" main.go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 package main import ( \"github.com/atlanhq/atlan-go/atlan/assets\" ) func main () { ctx := assets . NewContext () } On client creation ¶ If you prefer to not use environment variables, you can do the following: main.go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 package main import ( \"github.com/atlanhq/atlan-go/atlan/assets\" ) func main () { ctx , _ := assets . Context ( \"https://tenant.atlan.com\" , \"...\" ) } Careful not to expose your API token! We generally discourage including your API token directly in your code, in case you accidentally commit it into a (public) version control system. But it's your choice exactly how you manage the API token and including it for use within the client. That's it — once these are set you can start using your SDK to make live calls against your Atlan instance! 🎉 What's next? ¶ Delve into more detailed examples: Common tasks Common operations on assets, that are available across all assets. Discover actions Asset-specific Operations that are specific to certain assets. Focus on a specific kind of asset Governance structures Operations dealing with governance structures, rather than assets. Manage governance structures Samples Real code samples our customers use to solve particular use cases. Review live samples Searching Delve deep into searching and aggregating metadata. Learn more about searching Events Delve deep into the details of the events Atlan triggers. Learn more about events Error-handling ¶ The SDK defines exceptions for the following categories of error: Exception Description ApiConnectionError Errors when the SDK is unable to connect to the API, for example due to a lack of network access or timeouts. AuthenticationError Errors when the API token configured for the SDK is invalid or expired. ConflictError Errors when there is some conflict with an existing asset and the operation cannot be completed as a result. InvalidRequestError Errors when the request sent to Atlan does not match its expectations. If you are using the built-in methods like toCreate() and toUpdate() this exception should be treated as a bug in the SDK. (These operations take responsibility for avoiding this error.) LogicError Errors where some assumption made in the SDK's code is proven incorrect. If ever raised, they should be reported as bugs against the SDK. NotFoundError Errors when the requested resource or asset does not exist in Atlan. PermissionError Errors when the API token used by the SDK does not have permission to access a resource or carry out an operation on a specific asset . RateLimitError Errors when the Atlan server is being overwhelm",

Obtain the CLI Configure the CLI Define data sources What's next? Atlan CLI ¶ Limited functionality (so far) You can use Atlan's command-line interface (CLI) to manage some metadata in Atlan. Currently data contracts and metadata for a limited set of asset types can be managed through the CLI. Obtain the CLI ¶ 0.1.0 For now, the CLI must be downloaded as a pre-built binary: Disclaimer — closed preview This feature is in closed preview and therefore any download and installation from this link will be subject to the terms applicable to Product Release Stages .

Homebrew MacOS (M1) MacOS (Intel) Linux Windows Windows Recommended When installed via Homebrew, you can easily keep things up-to-date. If you do not use it already, see Homebrew's own installation documents for setting up Homebrew itself . brew tap atlanhq/atlan brew install atlan curl -o atlan.tgz -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz tar xf atlan.tgz curl -o atlan.tgz -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Darwin_amd64.tar.gz tar xf atlan.tgz curl -o atlan.tgz -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Linux_amd64.tar.gz tar -zxf atlan.tgz curl -o atlan.zip -L https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-cli-releases/releases/latest/download/atlan_Windows_amd64.zip unzip atlan.zip Configure the CLI ¶ 0.1.0 You can configure the CLI using a config file or in some cases environment variables, with the following minimum settings 1 : .atlan/config.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 atlan_api_key : eyZid92... # (1) atlan_base_url : https://tenant.atlan.com # (2) log : enabled : false # (3) level : info # (4) An API token that has access to your assets. The base URL of your tenant (including the https:// ). (Optional) Enable logging to produce more details on what the CLI is doing. When logging is enabled, specify the level of verbosity. Environment variables 1 ATLAN_API_KEY = eyZid92... # (1) An API token that has access to your assets. Define data sources ¶ You should also define data sources in the config file: .atlan/config.yaml 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 data_source snowflake : # (1) type : snowflake # (2) connection : # (3) name : snowflake-prod # (4) qualified_name : \"default/snowflake/1234567890\" # (5) database : db # (6) schema : analytics # (7) Each data source definition must start with data_source , followed by a space and a unique reference name for the data source ( snowflake in this example). Reference name is your choice The reference name you give in the configuration file is only used here and as a reference in any data contracts you define. It need not match the name of the connection or data source in Atlan itself. You must indicate the type of connector for the data source (see connector types for options). Details of the connection must also be provided. You must provide the name of the connection, as it appears in Atlan. You must provide the unique qualified_name of the connection in Atlan. (Optional) You can also specify the database to use for this connection's assets by default, if none is specified in the data contract. (Optional) You can also specify the schema to use for this connection's assets by default, if none is specified in the data contract. These ensure the CLI can map the details you specify in your data contract to the appropriate corresponding asset in Atlan. What's next?",

are a way to provide programmatic access to Atlan without relying on a user's own credentials or permissions. API tokens are not personal access tokens API tokens are commonly thought to be synonymous with personal access tokens (PAT). In other words, many developers assume that an API token will have the same privileges and permissions as the user who created them. This is not the case. API tokens are their own unique actor and carry entirely their own set of permissions, completely independent from the user who created or otherwise maintains them. Create an API token ¶ 0.0.14 1.4.0 4.0.0 To create a new API token: Java Python Kotlin Go Raw REST API Create an API token 1 2 ApiToken token = ApiToken . create ( client , \"token-name\" ); // (1) String tokenValue = token . getAttributes (). getAccessToken (); // (2) You can use the ApiToken.create() method to create a new API token. Because this operation will create the token in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. The actual value of the API token will only be available in this immediate response of the creation, under .getAttributes().getAccessToken() . Cannot be accessed again later You will not be able to retrieve the actual value of the API token again at a later point, for example when retrieving or updating the API token. Create an API token 1 2 3 4 5 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient client = AtlanClient () token = client . token . create ( \"token-name\" ) # (1) token_value = token . attributes . access_token # (2) You can use the token.create() method to create a new API token. The actual value of the API token will only be available in this immediate response of the creation, under .attributes.access_token . Cannot be accessed again later You will not be able to retrieve the actual value of the API token again at a later point, for example when retrieving or updating the API token. Create an API token 1 2 val token = ApiToken . create ( client , \"token-name\" ) // (1) val tokenValue = token . attributes . accessToken // (2) You can use the ApiToken.create() method to create a new API token.

personalization ¶ Atlan provides a number of ways to manage access control , at both coarse-grained and granular levels. The primary vehicles for granular access control are personas , purposes , and the access policies defined within these. Both personas and purposes can also be used to personalize the experience, by controlling: which assets are visible to a particular audience which details of each of those assets are visible 2023-01-27 2024-03-14 Was this page helpful?

Retrieve policies From a persona From a purpose Update policies Remove policies From a persona From a purpose /api/meta/entity/bulk (DELETE) /api/meta/entity/bulk (POST) /api/meta/search/indexsearch (POST) Policies ¶ Policies control which assets users can access, and what operations they can carry out on those assets. Retrieve policies ¶ From a persona ¶ 0.0.15 1.4.0 4.0.0 To retrieve a policy from a persona, you need to search for the policy by some characteristic: Java Python Kotlin Go Raw REST API Retrieve policies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 AuthPolicy . select ( client ) // (1) . where ( AuthPolicy . POLICY_CATEGORY . eq ( \"persona\" )) . where ( AuthPolicy . POLICY_RESOURCES . startsWith ( \"entity:default/snowflake/1696324735\" )) // (2) . includeOnResults ( AuthPolicy . NAME ) // (3) . includeOnResults ( AuthPolicy . ACCESS_CONTROL ) . includeOnResults ( AuthPolicy . POLICY_RESOURCES ) . includeOnResults ( AuthPolicy . CONNECTION_QUALIFIED_NAME ) . includeOnResults ( AuthPolicy . POLICY_TYPE ) . includeOnResults ( AuthPolicy . POLICY_SUB_CATEGORY ) . includeOnRelations ( IAccessControl . IS_ACCESS_CONTROL_ENABLED ) // (4) . includeOnRelations ( Asset . NAME ) . stream () // (5) . filter ( a -> a instanceof AuthPolicy ) . forEach ( p -> { // (6) AuthPolicy policy = ( AuthPolicy ) p ; }); Start by selecting policies, here using a FluentSearch-based approach. Because this operation may need to retrieve information from Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. You can select the policy by whatever you like, in this example we are selecting based on the resources it controls (specifically in this example any assets in a particular snowflake connection). Include details about the policy itself in each search result, such as the access control mechanism the policy is defined within (the persona). Include all the attributes you want about the access control mechanism on the relations of the search results. Here we are including the name of and whether that persona is enabled or not. You can then directly stream the results of the search. For each result of the search (itself an AuthPolicy), you can then decide what to do with it. Retrieve policies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 from typing import cast from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.model.assets import AuthPolicy , AccessControl from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import FluentSearch client = AtlanClient () request = ( FluentSearch () . where ( FluentSearch . asset_type ( AuthPolicy )) # (1) . where ( AuthPolicy .

actions with assets ¶ In this section you'll find examples of the most common actions dealing with assets . All assets share a common set of attributes and relationships: such as certificates, announcements, term assignments, classifications, custom metadata, READMEs, and more. These common examples cover interacting with those common attributes and relationships — focusing primarily on enriching assets that already exist. Each page includes variations on the topic they cover: Certify assets Manage announcements Change description Change owners Classify assets Change custom metadata Link terms to assets Manage asset READMEs Add asset links 2022-10-15 2024-12-02 Was this page helpful?

operations ¶ In this section you'll find details about creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and searching for assets . Rather than covering every asset type in detail (since there are many), the subsections focus on the operations and patterns to follow for each operation. For more details on specific assets that are primarily intended to be managed programmatically, see the API-first models . Create an asset Retrieve an asset Update an asset Delete an asset Restore an asset View history of an asset Search for assets In many cases, you can also combine multiple operations into a single API call for efficiency. 2022-10-17 2024-10-01 Was this page helpful?

material ¶ Under this top-level menu you will find full reference materials. These are intended to cover full, in-depth explanations of everything you can use in different areas of Atlan. Searching — detailing all the different mechanisms you can use to search for metadata in Atlan. Events — detailing every type of event that Atlan produces and the triggers that produce them. Endpoints — listing every endpoint available in Atlan cross-referenced with the use cases each endpoint enables. Due to its size, the full reference material for types (models) is under the separate top-level Types menu. 2025-09-04 2023-08-02 Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

We recommend using one of our software development kits (SDKs) , if possible, which: encode best practices, are built for performance, and add validations and simplifications not found in the raw REST APIs themselves. Did you know? Our SDKs are nothing more than client libraries that wrap our underlying REST APIs. They prevent you from needing to reinvent the wheel by wrapping the REST APIs yourself.

    "content": "Get Started What is Atlan? On this page What is Atlan? We are a modern data workspace that makes collaboration among diverse users like business, analysts, and engineers easier, increasing efficiency and agility in data projects. We started out as a data team, solving social good problems using data science. We built Atlan for ourselves over the course of 200 data projects, which included India's national data platform used by the prime minister and monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals with the United Nations. Atlan helped us build India's national data platform with an 8-member team, making it the fastest project of its kind to go live in just 12 months - instead of the projected three years. Why we built Atlan ​ Data teams can be diverse: analysts, scientists, engineers, and business users. Diverse people with diverse tools and skillsets mean diverse DNAs. All of it led to chaos, which made our Slack channels look like this... We call this \"collaboration overheard\" ​ We knew we couldn't scale like this, there had to be a better way. We borrowed the principles of Agile from product teams, DevOps from engineering teams, and Lean Manufacturing from supply chain teams. We then experimented for two years and across 200 data projects to create our own idea of what makes data teams successful. We call this DataOps . How Atlan helps data teams ​ With Atlan, analyst teams at Unilever have shipped 100+ additional data projects per quarter, while data science teams at Samsung have saved 50% of their time. Create self-service ecosystems by reducing dependencies ​ Atlan makes all your data assets easily discoverable. No more Slack messages like \"Where's that dataset?\" or long email threads for approvals. With Atlan, you can simply Cmd+K your way to the right data asset. Key capabilities : discovery and search , Visual Query Builder , saved queries , READMEs Improve the agility of your data team ​ Data practitioners spend 30-50% of their time finding and understanding data. Atlan cuts that time by 95%. Your data team will be shipping 2-3 times more projects in no time. Key capabilities : visibility of data quality tests and observability alerts, automated lineage , Atlan AI Promote governance and a sustainable data culture ​ Don't lose sleep trying to figure out if your sensitive data is secure. Build ecosystems of trust, make your team happy, and let Atlan manage governance and security behind the scenes.

    "content": "Get Started Quick Start Guides Administrators On this page Administrators User management ​ User management is a critical part of data governance. Atlan's user management capabilities should be a mainstay of how you organize and control access for people in your organization. Add and manage users from the admin center ​ It's super simple to invite and remove users from Atlan from the Admin center . You can also manage existing users by adding them to groups, changing their roles, or set up SSO , SCIM , and SMTP configurations. Manage access control from the governance center ​ The Governance center is where you can build access control mechanisms to manage user access . Personas allow you to group users into teams, such as Financial Analysts or Cloud Engineers , and set policies based on the access those personas should have. Purposes are where you can build policies based on the actions or access that a user might need. For example, you can use Atlan's policy-based access controls to manage access to PII and other sensitive data. This is a best practice for data governance. Once you set these policies, Atlan will enforce them throughout your users' experience. This means that users who don't have access to a particular type of data will not be able to see it. Governance workflows help you set up robust controls on data access management, metadata enrichment, new entity creation, and more, with out-of-the-box workflow templates and automated execution. Asset profile ​ The asset profile in Atlan gives you a quick and clear understanding of what a data asset contains. You can think of the asset profile as the TL;DR about your data. Glossary ​ The Atlan glossary is a rich tool for defining and organizing your data terminology to improve transparency and share knowledge. No need to ask around for what a column name means. The glossary functions as a source of truth for teams to understand their data assets. Start keeping all your definitions in one searchable place. The glossary provides key intel on your data assets so you can quickly understand important attributes of your data, such as: Owners of your data, so you know who to ask for clarification. Certificate status, to easily understand if metadata enrichment is still in progress or the asset is ready to be used. Linked assets that are relevant to the term, so you can explore other helpful material. Did you know? The glossary helps power Atlan's powerful search tool , so tagging and defining assets are critical to helping your team find what they need. Discovery ​ We rely on search bars to find things in almost every corner of the internet. Atlan uses a similar search tool to help you explore your data assets. The discovery tool is Atlan's powerful in-platform search, powered by the terms and descriptions you've added to your data assets. Here are a few of the things that make Atlan's discovery awesome: Every attribute of your data is searchable in Atlan - saved SQL queries, schemas, links, and more. This lets you search far and wide to find exactly what you need. Intelligent keyword recognition sees through your typos to show exactly what you wanted, no matter what you actually typed. Search assets from just about any page in Atlan using Cmd/Ctrl+K or by clicking Search assets across Atlan at the top of any page. Control your search by using facets about your data (such as the verification status or owner) to find what's most important to you. Sort by popularity to quickly discover what assets your teammates are using every day. Tags: get-started quick-start Previous What is Atlan?

    "title": "Set up Snowflake | Atlan Documentation",
    "url": "https://docs.atlan.com/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/set-up-snowflake",
    "content": "Connect data Data Warehouses Snowflake Get Started Set up Snowflake On this page Set up Snowflake Who can do this? You need your Snowflake administrator to run these commands - you may not have access yourself. Create user and role in Snowflake ​ Create a role and user in Snowflake using the following commands: Create role ​ Create a role in Snowflake using the following commands: CREATE OR REPLACE ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT OPERATE , USAGE ON WAREHOUSE \"<warehouse-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <warehouse-name> with the default warehouse to use when running the Snowflake crawler . Atlan requires the following privileges to: OPERATE enables Atlan to start the virtual warehouse to fetch metadata if the warehouse has stopped. USAGE enables Atlan to show or list metadata from Snowflake. This in turn enables the Snowflake crawler to run the SHOW query. Create a user ​ Create a separate user to integrate into Atlan, using one of the following 3 options: With a public key in Snowflake ​ See Snowflake's official guide for details on generating an RSA key-pair . To create a user with a key-pair, replace the value for rsa_public_key with the public key and run the following: CREATE USER atlan_user rsa_public_key = 'MIIBIjANBgkqh...' default_role = atlan_user_role default_warehouse = '<warehouse-name>' display_name = 'Atlan' TYPE = 'SERVICE' Learn more about the SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Did you know? Atlan only supports encrypted private keys with a non-empty passphrase - generally recommended as more secure. An empty passphrase results in workflow failures. To generate an encrypted private key, omit the -nocrypt option. Refer to Snowflake documentation to learn more. With a password in Snowflake ​ Did you know? Snowflake recommends transitioning away from basic authentication using username and password. Change to key-pair authentication for enhanced security. For any existing Snowflake workflows, you can modify the crawler configuration to update the authentication method. To create a user with a password, replace <password> and run the following: CREATE USER atlan_user password = '<password>' default_role = atlan_user_role default_warehouse = '<warehouse-name>' display_name = 'Atlan' TYPE = 'LEGACY_SERVICE' Learn more about the LEGACY_SERVICE type property in Snowflake documentation . Managed through your identity provider (IdP) Private preview ​ This method is currently only available if Okta is your IdP (Snowflake supports) authenticating natively through Okta : Create a user in your identity provider (IdP) and use federated authentication in Snowflake . The password for this user must be maintained solely in the IdP and multi-factor authentication (MFA) must be disabled. Grant role to user ​ To grant the atlan_user_role to the new user: GRANT ROLE atlan_user_role TO USER atlan_user ; Configure OAuth (client credentials flow) with Microsoft Entra ID ​ To configure OAuth authentication using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) with the client credentials flow: Follow Snowflake's documentation to: Register a new application in Microsoft Entra ID Collect the client ID , tenant ID , and client secret Add the required API permissions In Snowflake, create a security integration using the following: CREATE SECURITY INTEGRATION external_oauth_azure_ad TYPE = external_oauth ENABLED = true EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TYPE = azure EXTERNAL_OAUTH_ISSUER = '\\<AZURE_AD_ISSUER\\>' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_JWS_KEYS_URL = '\\<AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT\\>' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_AUDIENCE_LIST = ( '\\<SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI\\>' ) EXTERNAL_OAUTH_TOKEN_USER_MAPPING_CLAIM = 'sub' EXTERNAL_OAUTH_SNOWFLAKE_USER_MAPPING_ATTRIBUTE = 'login_name' ; Replace the placeholders with actual values from your Azure AD app: <AZURE_AD_ISSUER> → Your tenant's OAuth 2.0 issuer URL <AZURE_AD_JWS_KEY_ENDPOINT> → Azure JWKs URI <SNOWFLAKE_APPLICATION_ID_URI> → Application ID URI of the Azure app Create a Snowflake user with a login name that exactly matches the Azure AD client object ID: CREATE USER oauth_svc_user WITH LOGIN_NAME = '\\<AZURE_AD_CLIENT_OBJECT_ID\\>' -- Use Azure client OBJECT ID DEFAULT_ROLE = \\ < ROLE\\ > DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = \\ < WAREHOUSE\\ > ; Grant the configured role to this user: GRANT ROLE \\ < ROLE\\ > TO USER oauth_svc_user ; Choose metadata fetching method ​ Atlan supports two methods for fetching metadata from Snowflake - account usage and information schema. You should choose one of these two methods to set up Snowflake: Account usage Information schema Overview Simplified grants but some limitations in functionality Most comprehensive approach, more grant management required Method Views in the SNOWFLAKE database that display object metadata and usage metrics for your account System-defined views and table functions that provide extensive metadata for objects created in your account Permissions User role and account, single grant for SNOWFLAKE database User role and account, multiple grants per database Data latency 45 minutes to 3 hours (varies by view) None Historical data retention 1 year 7 days to 6 months (varies by view or table function) Asset extraction ACCOUNT_USAGE schema INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema View lineage ACCOUNT_USAGE schema INFORMATION_SCHEMA schema Table lineage ACCOUNT_USAGE schema ACCOUNT_USAGE schema Tag import ACCOUNT_USAGE schema ACCOUNT_USAGE schema Usage and popularity ACCOUNT_USAGE schema ACCOUNT_USAGE schema Metadata extraction time Varies by warehouse size. For example, 8 minutes for 10 million assets (recommended for extracting a large number of assets) Varies by warehouse size. For example, 2+ hours for 10 million assets Extraction limitations External table location data, procedures, and primary and foreign keys None Grant permissions for account usage method ​ danger If you want to set warehouse timeouts when using this method, set a large value initially for the workflow to succeed. Once the workflow has succeeded, adjust the value to be twice the extraction time. This method uses the views in SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE (or a copied version of this schema) to fetch the metadata from Snowflake into Atlan. You can be more granular with permissions using this method, but there are limitations with this approach . To crawl assets, generate lineage, and import tags ​ If you also want to be able to preview and query the data, you can use the preview and query existing assets permissions instead. Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , you need to grant the same permissions to import tags as required for crawling Snowflake assets. Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . To use the default SNOWFLAKE database and ACCOUNT_USAGE schema and also mine Snowflake's query history (for lineage), grant these permissions: USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN ; GRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; The ACCOUNTADMIN role is required to grant privileges on the SNOWFLAKE database due to the following reasons: By default, only the ACCOUNTADMIN role can access the SNOWFLAKE database. To enable other roles to access the database and schemas and query the views, a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role needs to grant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database to the desired roles. To use a copied or cloned version of this default schema, where you can also remove any sensitive data for security purposes, grant these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA \"<copied-schema>\" IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<copied-database>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <copied-database> with the copied Snowflake database name. Replace <copied-schema> with the copied Snowflake ACCOUNT_USAGE schema name. The grants for the copied version can't be used on the original SNOWFLAKE database. This is because Snowflake produces an error that granular grants can't be given to imported databases. When using a cloned or copied version, verify that the table or view definition remains unchanged as in your SNOWFLAKE database. If the format is different. For example, a column is missing and it no longer qualifies as a clone. To crawl streams ​ To crawl streams, provide the following permissions: To crawl current streams: GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the Snowflake database name. To crawl future streams: GRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT REFERENCES ON FUTURE TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the Snowflake database name. (Optional) To preview and query existing assets ​ To query and preview data within assets that already exist in Snowflake, add these permissions: GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL EXTERNAL TABLES IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL MATERIALIZED VIEWS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT SELECT ON ALL STREAMS IN DATABASE \"<database-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; GRANT MONITOR ON PIPE \"<pipe-name>\" TO ROLE atlan_user_role ; Replace <database-name> with the database you want to be able to preview an",

most of the write operations covered in the above sections, you can also: Combine multiple operations together Make changes to multiple assets at the same time Optimize changes These each allow you to optimize your work. Rather than making a separate API call for each change or each asset, you can make a single API call that includes all your changes — even across many assets. Of course, in order to change multiple assets you also need to first know which assets to change. To do this, there is a common end-to-end bulk update pattern you can follow. 2023-04-12 2024-04-22 Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

you want to process metadata as it evolves, in real-time, then you'll want to tap into events. Currently in Atlan, you can create webhooks that will send all metadata activity to a target URL of your choice. In this section you'll find common scenarios to write such a target to handle these events: Webhook <> Lambda handling events through an AWS Lambda function 2023-03-06 2024-03-14 Was this page helpful?

API-first models Asset creation order Creating assets ¶ API-first models ¶ There are several types in Atlan that are intended for use primarily through the APIs and SDKs: Relational databases, schemas, tables, views, columns (and more) Object store assets: AWS S3 buckets and objects Azure Data Lake Storage accounts, containers, and objects Google Cloud Storage buckets and objects Business intelligence assets: Google Data Studio sources and reports Preset workspaces, dashboards, charts, and datasets Superset dashboards, charts, and datasets API specs, paths, objects, queries and fields App assets AI assets (AI models, AI applications) Insights assets Asset creation order ¶ When creating data assets in Atlan, the order in which you create them is important. At the top level of all data assets in Atlan is the Connection . Connections are the basis for access control, so you must create (or use an existing) connection before you can create any other assets. You must then create each subsequent level of the data asset's structure(s) in parent-first order. You can bulk-create assets at the same level While parent assets must exist before creating child assets, you can create multiple assets at the same level all at the same time. Example: relational database structure You must first create a Connection (or decide to reuse an existing one). You can then create any number Database s within that connection, at the same time. You can then create any number of Schema s within any of those databases, at the same time. You can then create any number of Table s or View s within any of those schemas, at the same time. And you can then finally create any number of Column s within any of those tables or views, at the same time. 2023-04-12 2025-07-29 Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

    "content": "On this page Once you have set up the databricks-extractor tool , you can extract metadata from your on-premises Databricks instances by completing the following steps. Run databricks-extractor ​ Crawl all Databricks connections ​ To crawl all Databricks connections using the databricks-extractor tool: Log into the server with Docker Compose installed. Change to the directory containing the compose file. Run Docker Compose: sudo docker-compose up Crawl a specific connection ​ To crawl a specific Databricks connection using the databricks-extractor tool: Log into the server with Docker Compose installed. Change to the directory containing the compose file. Run Docker Compose: sudo docker-compose up <connection-name> (Replace <connection-name> with the name of the connection from the services section of the compose file.) (Optional) Review generated files ​ The databricks-extractor tool will generate many folders with JSON files for each service . For example: catalogs schemas tables You can inspect the metadata and make sure it is acceptable for providing metadata to Atlan. Upload generated files to S3 ​ To provide Atlan access to the extracted metadata, you will need to upload the metadata to an S3 bucket. Did you know? We recommend uploading to the same S3 bucket as Atlan uses to avoid access issues. Reach out to your Data Success Manager to get the details of your Atlan bucket. To create your own bucket, refer to the Create your own S3 bucket section of the dbt documentation. (The steps will be exactly the same.) To upload the metadata to S3: Ensure that all files for a particular connection have the same prefix. For example, output/databricks-example/catalogs/success/result-0.json , output/databricks-example/schemas/{{catalog_name}}/success/result-0.json , output/databricks-example/tables/{{catalog_name}}/success/result-0.json , and so on. Upload the files to the S3 bucket using your preferred method. For example, to upload all files using the AWS CLI : aws s3 cp output/databricks-example s3://my-bucket/metadata/databricks-example --recursive Crawl metadata in Atlan ​ Once you have extracted metadata on-premises and uploaded the results to S3, you can crawl the metadata into Atlan: How to crawl Databricks Be sure to select Offline for the Extraction method .

    "title": "Set up Amazon Redshift | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page Who can do this? You will need your Amazon Redshift administrator to run these commands - you may not have access yourself. Atlan supports fetching metadata from Amazon Redshift for the following types of deployment: Provisioned RA3 DC2 Serverless danger If you're using the DC2 node type, Redshift restricts cross-database joins and metadata access to a single database. For more information, see Considerations - Amazon Redshift . Because of this restriction, you must set up a separate workflow for each database you want to crawl. Grant permissions ​ For all supported authentication mechanisms except IAM role authentication on serverless deployment , you must first grant the following permissions on Amazon Redshift. For IAM role authentication on serverless deployment only, skip to this step . Create a group and user ​ To create a group and user, run the following commands: CREATE GROUP atlan_users ; CREATE USER atlan_user password '<pass>' IN GROUP atlan_users ; Replace <pass> with the password for the atlan_user being created. To crawl Amazon Redshift , for Username , you must enter the username you configured for the database user. For example, atlan_user . Grant required permissions to group ​ To grant the minimum required permissions, run the following commands: GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; GRANT SELECT ON pg_catalog.svv_table_info TO GROUP atlan_users; Replace <schema_name> with the name of your schema. Repeat the above commands for all the databases in your schema( <schema_name> ). The permissions are used for the following: SVV_TABLE_INFO is used to obtain information on the table ID to table/schema/database relation. External schema ​ If your Redshift instance setup external schemas, you must grant permissions for each schema. Grant USAGE permissions ​ For external schemas, use the following command to grant USAGE permission: GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; Replace <schema_name> with the name of your schema. Repeat this command for all external schemas. Did you know? If your external tables are sourced from Amazon S3 and AWS Glue Catalog, granting only the USAGE permission is sufficient, provided that the IAM role associated with the Redshift cluster has read access to the data. (Optional) Grant SELECT permissions ​ For Redshift-based external schemas, you must explicitly grant SELECT along with USAGE permissions to allow metadata crawling. Use the following command to grant this permission: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; Replace <schema_name> with the name of your schema. Repeat the command for all the Redshift-based external schemas. Verify external schema permissions ​ Follow these steps to verify permissions granted to your external schema: Log in to the system using the IAM role created earlier. Run the following command using any database viewer tool: SELECT * FROM SVV_EXTERNAL_TABLES WHERE schema_name = '<external_schema_name>' Replace <external_schema_name> with the name of your external schema. If the tables appear in the results, the permissions are correctly configured. If you can't provide SELECT or USAGE access, create a cloned schema and grant access to the atlan_users group. For more information, see Cloned schema for restricted access section. Cloned schema for restricted access ​ If you can't grant USAGE or SELECT permissions to the atlan_users group, you must create a cloned schema containing the necessary metadata tables. Then, grant permissions to the cloned schema. Follow these steps to create a cloned schema and provide required permissions: Log in as dbadmin . Create a new schema and give it a meaningful name. For example, atlan . Clone the following views as tables from the pg_catalog schema into the cloned schema: pg_views SVV_TABLES SVV_EXTERNAL_TABLES SVV_COLUMNS Clone the following views as tables from the information_schema into the cloned schema: key_column_usage as information_schema_key_column_usage table_constraints as information_schema_table_constraints Grant USAGE and SELECT access to the atlan_users group on the cloned schema: GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <cloned_schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <cloned_schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; Replace <cloned_schema_name> with the name of your cloned schema. Since Atlan relies on these tables to crawl metadata, schedule a cron job to refresh the cloned tables periodically. Did you know? You can reach out to Atlan support if you need assistance with setting up a Cloned Schema. (Optional) Grant permissions for role-based authentication on serverless ​ For IAM role-based authentication on Amazon Redshift serverless deployment only, you must first grant the following permissions on Amazon Redshift. Create a role ​ To create a role, run the following commands: CREATE ROLE atlan_role ; Grant required permissions to role ​ To grant the minimum required permissions, run the following commands: GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; GRANT SELECT ON pg_catalog.svv_table_info TO GROUP atlan_users; Replace <schema_name> with the name of your schema. Repeat the above commands for all the databases in your schema( <schema_name> ). The permissions are used for the following: SVV_TABLE_INFO is used to obtain information on the table ID to table/schema/database relation. External schema ​ If your Redshift setup uses external schemas, you must grant permissions for each schema. You can do this in one of the following ways: Grant USAGE permissions ​ For external schemas, use the following command to grant USAGE permission: GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; Replace <schema_name> with the name of your schema. Repeat this command for all external schemas. Did you know? If your external tables are sourced from Amazon S3 and AWS Glue Catalog, granting only the USAGE permission is sufficient, provided that the IAM role associated with the Redshift cluster has read access to the data. (Optional) Grant SELECT permissions ​ For Redshift-based external schemas, you must explicitly grant SELECT along with USAGE permissions to allow metadata crawling. Use the following command to grant this permission: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <schema_name> TO GROUP atlan_users; Replace <schema_name> with the name of your schema. Repeat the command for all the Redshift-based external schemas. Verify external schema permissions ​ Follow these steps to verify permissions granted to your external schema: Log in to the system using the IAM role created earlier. Run the following command using the Amazon Redshift Data API : SELECT * FROM SVV_EXTERNAL_TABLES WHERE schema_name = '<external_schema_name>' Replace <external_schema_name> with the name of your external schema. If the tables appear in the results, the permissions are correctly configured. If you can't provide SELECT or USAGE access, create a cloned schema and grant access to the atlan_users group. For more information, see Cloned schema for restricted access section. Cloned schema for restricted access ​ If you can't grant USAGE or SELECT permissions to the atlan_users group, you must create a cloned schema containing the necessary metadata tables. Then, grant permissions to the cloned schema. Follow these steps to create a cloned schema and provide required permissions: Log in as dbadmin . Create a new schema and give it a meaningful name.

Since Atlan relies on these tables to crawl metadata, schedule a cron job to refresh the cloned tables periodically. Did you know? You can reach out to Atlan support if you need assistance with setting up a Cloned Schema. Grant additional permissions for mining query history ​ Did you know? For mining query history from Redshift Serverless, permissions on STL and SVL views are not required as they do not exist in serverless deployment. To grant the additional permissions needed to mine query history, run the following commands: GRANT SELECT on pg_catalog . stl_ddltext to GROUP atlan_users ; GRANT SELECT on pg_catalog . stl_query to GROUP atlan_users ; GRANT SELECT on pg_catalog . stl_connection_log to GROUP atlan_users ; GRANT SELECT on pg_catalog . stl_undone to GROUP atlan_users ; GRANT SELECT on pg_catalog . stl_insert to GROUP atlan_users ; GRANT SELECT on pg_catalog . svl_statementtext to GROUP atlan_users ; ALTER USER atlan_user SYSLOG ACCESS UNRESTRICTED ; The additional permissions are used for the following: STL_DDLTEXT is used for DDL queries. STL_QUERY is used for DML and regular queries. STL_CONNECTION_LOG is used to obtain the session ID that a query is part of. STL_UNDONE is used to obtain information about transactions that have been undone or rolled back. STL_INSERT is used to obtain the table ID used in the insert queries. SVL_STATEMENTTEXT is used to obtain the query text for all queries. SYSLOG ACCESS UNRESTRICTED is used to access all queries performed by any user in the system tables above. To use basic authentication, your setup is now complete. To configure IAM-based authentication, you need to continue with the following steps. (Optional) Create IAM policy ​ All IAM-based authentication mechanisms require an IAM policy to be created. For all supported authentication mechanisms except IAM role authentication on serverless deployment , create the following IAM policy. For IAM role authentication on serverless deployment only, skip to this step . To create an IAM policy with the necessary permissions follow the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . Create the policy using the following JSON: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"redshift:GetClusterCredentials\" ] , \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:redshift:<region>:<account_id>:dbuser:<redshift_cluster_identifier>/atlan_user\" , \"arn:aws:redshift:<region>:<account_id>:dbname:<redshift_cluster_identifier>/<database>\" ] } ] } Replace <region> with the AWS region of your Redshift instance. Replace <account_id> with your account ID. Replace <redshift_cluster_identifier> with your Redshift cluster identifier. Replace <database> with the name of the Redshift database. (Optional) Create IAM policy for role-based authentication on serverless ​ For IAM role-based authentication on Amazon Redshift serverless deployment only, create an IAM policy with the necessary permissions. Follow the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . Create the policy using the following JSON: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"redshift-serverless:GetCredentials\" ] , \"Resource\" : [ \"arn:aws:redshift-serverless:<region>:<account_id>:workgroup/<workgroup_identifier>\" , ] } ] } Replace <region> with the AWS region of your Amazon Redshift instance. Replace <account_id> with your AWS account ID. Replace <workgroup_identifier> with your Amazon Redshift serverless workgroup identifier. Configure tag for IAM role: { RedshiftDbRoles : <role> } Replace <role> with the role you created . (Optional) Choose IAM-based authentication mechanism ​ Using the policy created above, configure one of the following options for authentication. User-based authentication ​ To configure user-based authentication: Create an AWS IAM user by following the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . On the Set permissions page, attach the policy created in the previous step to this user. Once the user is created, view or download the user's access key ID and secret access key . danger This will be your only opportunity to view or download the access keys. You will not have access to them again after leaving the user creation screen. Role delegation-based authentication ​ To configure role delegation-based authentication: Raise a support ticket to get the ARN of the Node Instance Role for your Atlan EKS cluster. Create a new role in your AWS account by following the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . When prompted for policies, attach the policy created in the previous step to this role. When prompted, create a trust relationship for the role using the following trust policy. (Replace <atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn> with the ARN received from Atlan support.) { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"<atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn>\" } , \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" , \"Condition\" : { } } ] } (Optional) To use an external ID for additional security, paste the external ID into the policy: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"<atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn>\" } , \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" , \"Condition\" : { \"StringEquals\" : { \"sts:ExternalId\" : \"<atlan_external_id>\" } } } ] } Replace <atlan_external_id> with the external ID you want to use. Now, reach out to Atlan support with: The name of the role you created above. The ID of the AWS account where the role was created. danger Wait until the support team confirms the account is allowlisted to assume the role before running the crawler.

    "title": "SlackDiscussionReporter - Developer",
    "content": "SlackDiscussionReporter ¶ This content has moved! We have moved our samples to a separate, dedicated site: https://solutions.atlan.com . This document is no longer being maintained. Extracts counts of the number of Slack conversations tracked against each asset, producing an Excel workbook consisting of 1 worksheet with the following columns: Column name Usage Qualified name Unique name of the asset. Type Type of the asset. Name Human-readable name of the asset. Slack Number of discussions through Slack linked to this asset. Link Link to the asset in Atlan. Configuration ¶ You can configure the following options for this reporter as environment variables: ATLAN_BASE_URL ¶ URL for your Atlan tenant (for example: https://tenant.atlan.com ). ATLAN_API_KEY ¶ API token to use when accessing Atlan. BATCH_SIZE ¶ Defines how many records the API calls attempt to retrieve on each request. (Defaults to 50 if not specified.) FILE_PREFIX ¶ Defines what the Excel file's name will start with. (Defaults to slack-discussion-report if not specified.) REGION ¶ Defines the AWS region of the S3 bucket where you want to write the Excel file output. BUCKET ¶ Defines the S3 bucket where you want the reporter to store the Excel file output. (Note that there is no default value for this, so this must be sent for the utility to run via a Lambda function and produce consumable output — if blank (default) the reporter produces a local Excel file.) Lambda configuration ¶ To use this reporter as an AWS Lambda function, you can configure the same variables as above, but send them in a JSON structure: Lambda configuration { \"BATCH_SIZE\" : \"50\" , \"FILE_PREFIX\" : \"slack-discussion-report\" , \"REGION\" : \"ap-south-1\" , \"BUCKET\" : \"\" } Logging ¶ By default, only messages at INFO and above will be logged (to the console). You can change this level by copying the main/resources/log4j2.xml from the source repo and modifying it to give: more detail ( DEBUG will log every API request and response, including their full payloads) less detail ( WARN will only print warnings and errors, ERROR only errors). Running the reporters locally ¶ You can run the reporters locally on any machine with network access to your Atlan tenant. When run in this mode, the reporter will read the input Excel file locally on the machine running the reporter. If you want to change any of the settings , you can simply prepend the command with the environment variables. You can run the SlackDiscussionReporter by downloading the pre-compiled jar files for both: With this approach you only need a JRE installed, as you will be using pre-compiled code. Requires at least Java 11, though 17+ is recommended You must have a Java 11 (or higher) JRE installed to use the samples. If possible, we recommend using Java 17 (or higher) for significantly improved performance. macOS Windows Windows Linux Using Gradle Run SlackDiscussionReporter from pre-compiled jar files 1 2 3 4 5 6 export ATLAN_BASE_URL = https://tenant.atlan.com # (1) export ATLAN_API_KEY = eyNnCJd2T9Y8fEsbdx... export FILE_PREFIX = slack java \\ -cp atlan-java-...-jar-with-dependencies.jar:atlan-java-samples-...-jar-with-dependencies.jar \\ com.atlan.samples.reporters.SlackDiscussionReporter # (2) Export environment variables for the configuration you want to use.

Replace the ... with proper version numbers Don't forget to replace the ... in the -cp argument's values with proper version numbers, or running this will not work. You can also run the SlackDiscussionReporter from a clone of the samples repository: If you want to change the sample code provided to include additional logic, this is your best option. You have full control over all of the code this way and can make any changes you like before running it. Additional requirements You will need a JDK installed to run this way, not only the JRE, as the code must be compiled locally before it can be executed. The computer on which you run the code must also have network access to be able to configure Gradle itself and download the necessary dependencies of the code from Maven Central. Run SlackDiscussionReporter from a clone of the GitHub repo export FILE_PREFIX = slack ./gradlew SlackDiscussionReporter # (1)! Within the root directory of your local clone of the repo, run the Gradle task for the SlackDiscussionReporter . Overriding the configuration Note that you can specify any optional overrides as environment variables before running the loader. You can either do this in the same line where you run the command, or by exporting them first for example using export FILE_PREFIX=slack .

    "content": "On this page Is the certified status in MicroStrategy mapped to the certificates field in Atlan? ​ No, the certified status in MicroStrategy is not mapped to the certificates field in Atlan. While the MicroStrategy certified field only supports a yes or no status, the certification field in Atlan supports multiple values. However, if your assets have been certified in MicroStrategy, you can view that information in the Properties tab of the asset sidebar in Atlan. Is the owner field in MicroStrategy mapped to the owners field in Atlan? ​ No, the asset owner in MicroStrategy is displayed as the source owner in the Overview section of the asset sidebar in Atlan. How is the upstream lineage for source tables calculated for cubes and reports? ​ Cubes or reports do not directly reference SQL tables or columns - they import attributes and metrics. Attributes can directly reference columns of SQL tables while metrics may reference an attribute, a fact, or another metric. Upstream lineage for cubes and reports is created by aggregating all the directly referenced SQL tables of the attributes and metrics that cubes and reports are sourced from. Why am I not seeing upstream lineage for attributes, facts, and metrics? ​ Atlan currently does not support upstream lineage for schema objects like attributes, facts, and metrics. Why are datasets created in a dossier missing from lineage? ​ Atlan currently does not support lineage for datasets directly created in a dossier due to limitations of the MicroStrategy REST APIs. The complete metadata required for creating lineage is unavailable. Does Atlan support document visualizations? ​ Atlan currently does not support document visualizations due to limitations of the MicroStrategy REST APIs.

    "content": "Weekly update ¶ This week we: Added creator() helpers for Airflow assets Further enhanced the (experimental) typedef toolkit Fixed a number of bugs Custom types ¶ In the toolkit, we've added: Further elements for generating the UX. A truncated index option for very long string attributes. We've fixed: The inclusion of attributeDefs in the output for all typedefs, even if empty. Python ¶ We've added: An AssetFilterGroup enum for persona personalization. creator() helper methods for Airflow assets. We've fixed: Accessibility of qualified_name in related glossary objects. Logic for removing parent category relationships through AtlasGlossaryCategory objects. Lineage list performance by avoiding unnecessary page retrievals using the hasMore attribute to short-circuit. An issue where explicit assignment of None to asset attributes in a bulk request followed by a client.asset.save() resulted in exclusion from the request payload. An issue with multiple remove/append relationships where values could be left out of a request due to the underlying dictionary management. Kotlin (and Java) ¶ We've added: creator() helper methods for Airflow assets. We've fixed: Accessibility of qualifiedName so it can still be accessed easily even if it is embedded in uniqueAttributes . Tracking of GUID assignments in batch operations when a real, existing GUID is provided as input in the batch and is thus re-used as-is rather than being re-assigned.

AI and Automation Features Guide to Atlan's AI capabilities and automation features for enhanced data governance and productivity. Atlan AI security Atlan uses [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/cognitive-services/openai-service) to power Atlan AI. Specifically, Atlan uses GPT-4o, a large, pretrained AI model. Attach a tag Atlan allows users to add [tags](/product/capabilities/governance/tags/concepts/what-are-tags) to assets. You can use them to identify key characteristics of assets or group them together for usage or data protection. Automate data profiling ➕Available via the Data Quality Studio package Can Atlan read a dump of SQL statements to create lineage? Atlan supports column-level lineage generation for cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, and more. Atlan [mines SQL queries](/. Can I be notified if there is a change in downstream dashboards or a schema drift? You can [create webhooks](/product/integrations/automation/webhooks/how-tos/create-webhooks) in Atlan to configure alerts or triggers for downstream actions for metadata change events, including schema changes. You can also configure alerts for asset creation or deletion events. Can I connect to any source with an ODBC/JDBC driver? A number of Atlan's [supported connectors](/product/connections/references/connectors-and-capabilities) use a JDBC- or REST API-based approach for metadata extraction. If you are attempting to connect to a source with no native integration, [contact Atlan support](/support/submit-request) to share more details about your use case. Can I query any DW/DL? You can query any data warehouse (DW) or data lake (DL) if the integration is supported via Atlan's [supported sources](/product/connections/references/supported-sources#data-sources). Once integrated, you will be able to query the underlying data using the [Insights](/product/capabilities/insights/how-tos/query-data) feature. Can I turn off sample data preview for the entire organization? Atlan recommends that you turn off sample data preview at a connection level. For example, you can configure the [Snowflake crawler](/apps/connectors/data-warehouses/snowflake/how-tos/crawl-snowflake) to prevent users from previewing any Snowflake data.

    "content": "On this page Once you have configured Tableau , you can establish a connection between Atlan and Tableau. (If you are also using a private network for Tableau, you will need to set that up first , too.) To crawl metadata from Tableau, review the order of operations and then complete the following steps. Select the source ​ To select Tableau as your source: In the top right of any screen, navigate to New and then click New Workflow . From the list of packages, select Tableau Assets and click on Setup Workflow . Provide credentials ​ In Direct extraction, Atlan connects to Tableau and crawls metadata directly. In Offline extraction, you need to first extract metadata yourself and make it available in S3 . In Agent extraction, Atlan’s secure agent executes metadata extraction within the organization's environment. Direct extraction method ​ To enter your Tableau credentials: For Host Name , enter the host name of your Tableau Online or Tableau Server instance (or the private DNS name if your Tableau Server instance uses an SSL certificate ). For Port , enter the port number of your Tableau instance. For Authentication , choose how you would like to connect to Tableau: For Basic authentication, enter the Username and Password you use to log in to Tableau. For Personal Access Token authentication, enter the Personal Access Token Name and Personal Access Token Value you generated _Create_a_personal_access_token). For JWT Bearer authentication, enter your Tableau Server username or Tableau Online email address for Username , and the Client ID , Secret ID , and Secret Value you copied from the connected app in Tableau. (Optional) For SSL , keep the default Enabled to use HTTPS or click Disabled to use HTTP. For Site , enter the name of the site you want to crawl. (If left blank, the default site will be used.) danger If you are using Tableau Online, the site is required for Atlan to authenticate properly. (Optional) For SSL certificate , this is only required if your Tableau Server instance uses a self-signed or an internal CA SSL certificate , paste a supported SSL certificate in the recommended format . At the bottom of the form, click the Test Authentication button to confirm connectivity to Tableau using these details. When successful, at the bottom of the screen click the Next button. Offline extraction method ​ Atlan also supports the offline extraction method for fetching metadata from Tableau. This method uses Atlan's tableau-extractor tool to fetch metadata. You will need to first extract the metadata yourself and then make it available in S3 . To enter your S3 details: For Bucket name , enter the name of your S3 bucket. For Bucket prefix , enter the S3 prefix under which all the metadata files exist. These include dashboards/result-0.json , workbooks/result-0.json , and so on. (Optional) For Bucket region , enter the name of the S3 region. When complete, at the bottom of the screen, click Next . Agent extraction method ​ Atlan supports using a Secure Agent for fetching metadata from Tableau. To use a Secure Agent, follow these steps: Select the Agent tab. Configure the Tableau data source by adding the secret keys for your secret store. For details on the required fields, refer to the Direct extraction section. Complete the Secure Agent configuration by following the instructions in the How to configure Secure Agent for workflow execution guide. Click Next after completing the configuration. Configure the connection ​ To complete the Tableau connection configuration: Provide a Connection Name that represents your source environment. For example, you might want to use values like production , development , gold , or analytics . (Optional) To change the users able to manage this connection, change the users or groups listed under Connection Admins . danger If you do not specify any user or group, nobody will be able to manage the connection - not even admins. Configure the crawler ​ Before running the Tableau crawler, you can further configure it. On the Metadata page, you can override the defaults for any of these options: To select the Tableau projects you want to include in crawling, click Include Projects . (This will default to all assets, if none are specified.) To select the Tableau projects you want to exclude from crawling, click Exclude Projects . (This will default to no assets, if none are specified.) To have the crawler ignore Tableau projects based on a naming convention, specify a regular expression in the Exclude Projects Regex field. To check for any permissions or other configuration issues before running the crawler, click Preflight checks . Did you know? If a project appears in both the include and exclude filters, the exclude filter takes precedence. (The Exclude Projects Regex also takes precedence.) Configure advanced controls ​ Before running the Tableau crawler, you can also configure advanced controls for the crawler. On the Advanced page, you can override the defaults for any of these options: For Alternate Host URL , enter the protocol and host name to be used for viewing assets directly in Tableau. For Crawl Unpublished Worksheets and Dashboards , click Yes to enable crawling hidden worksheets and dashboards or No to skip crawling them. For Hidden Datasource Fields , click Yes to enable crawling hidden datasource fields or No to skip crawling them. Crawl embedded dashboards: Embedded dashboard here means linking or displaying a dashboard inside another dashboard by providing a link to the dashboard in a Web Page item of the embedding dashboard. Click Yes to enable relationships between different embedded dashboards. Click No to skip creating relationships between embedded dashboards. Run the crawler ​ To run the Tableau crawler, after completing the steps above: You can either: To run the crawler once immediately, at the bottom of the screen, click the Run button. To schedule the crawler to run hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly, at the bottom of the screen, click the Schedule Run button. Once the crawler has completed running, you will see the assets in Atlan's asset page! 🎉 Select the source Provide credentials Configure the connection Configure the crawler Configure advanced controls Run the crawler",

Human-readable name for your connection, such as production or development . The connectorName must be exactly api . The qualifiedName should follow the pattern: default/api/<epoch> , where <epoch> is the time in milliseconds at which the connection is being created. The category must be API . List any workspace roles that can administer this connection. All users with that workspace role (current and future) will be administrators of the connection. Note that the values here need to be the GUID(s) of the workspace role(s). At least one of adminRoles , adminGroups , or adminUsers must be provided.

Note that the values here are the username(s) of the user(s). At least one of adminRoles , adminGroups , or adminUsers must be provided. Access policies Atlan creates the policies that grant access to a connection, including the ability to retrieve the connection and to create assets within it, asynchronously. It can take several seconds (even up to approximately 30 seconds) before these are in place after creating the connection. You may therefore need to wait before you'll be able to create the assets below within the connection. To confirm access, retrieve the connection after it has been created. The SDKs' retry loops will automatically retry until the connection can be successfully retrieved. At that point, your API token has permission to create the other assets. Note: if you are reusing an existing connection rather than creating one via your API token, you must give your API token a persona that has access to that connection. Otherwise all attempts to create, read, update, or delete assets within that connection will fail due to a lack of permissions. APISpec ¶ 2.0.0 4.0.0 An API spec requires a name and a qualifiedName . For creation, you also need to specify the connectionQualifiedName of the connection for the spec. Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Create an API spec 11 12 13 14 15 16 APISpec apiSpec = APISpec . creator ( // (1) \"api-spec\" , // (2) connectionQualifiedName ) // (3) . build (); AssetMutationResponse response = apiSpec . save ( client ); // (4) apiSpec = response . getResult ( apiSpec ); // (5) Build up the minimum request to create a spec. Provide a human-readable name for your spec. Provide the qualifiedName of the connection for this spec. Actually call Atlan to create the spec. Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant. Retrieve the created spec for use in subsequent creation calls.

Human-readable name for your spec. The qualifiedName should follow the pattern: default/api/<epoch>/<specName> , where default/api/<epoch> is the qualifiedName of the connection for this spec and <specName> is the name of this spec. The connectionQualifiedName must be the exact qualifiedName of the connection for this spec. The connectorName must be exactly api . APIPath ¶ 2.0.0 4.0.0 An API path requires a name and a qualifiedName . For creation, you also need to specify the connectionQualifiedName of the connection for the path and the apiSpec the path is in. If the name of your path does no give the URI of the endpoint it represents, be sure to also specify the apiPathRawURI . Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Create an API path 18 19 20 21 22 APIPath apiPath = APIPath . creator ( // (1) \"/api/path\" , // (2) apiSpec ) // (3) . build (); AssetMutationResponse response = apiPath . save ( client ); // (4) Build up the minimum request to create a path. Provide the unique endpoint URI for this path. (The SDK will also use this by default as the name for the path. If you want a different name, simply add a .name() call onto the builder with your preferred name.) Provide the spec for this path. If you did not already have the object, you could also use APISpec.refByGuid() with the GUID of the spec, or APISpec.refByQualifiedName() with the qualifiedName of the spec. Actually call Atlan to create the path. Because this operation will persist the asset in Atlan, you must provide it an AtlanClient through which to connect to the tenant.

Human-readable name for your path. The apiPathRawURI should be the unique endpoint URI this path represents. The qualifiedName should follow the pattern: default/api/<epoch>/<specName>/<apiPathRawURI> , where default/api/<epoch>/<specName> is the qualifiedName of the spec for this path and <apiPathRawURI> is the unique endpoint URI the path represents. The connectionQualifiedName must be the exact qualifiedName of the connection for this path. The connectorName must be exactly api . The spec in which this path exists is embedded in the apiSpec attribute. The typeName for this embedded reference must be APISpec . To complete the reference, you must include a uniqueAttributes object with the qualifiedName of the spec. Note: the spec must already exist in Atlan before creating the path. APIObject ¶ 2.5.3 An API object requires a name and a qualifiedName . For creation, you also need to specify the connectionQualifiedName of the connection for the object. Optionally, you can also provide the count of API field that exists in the object as apiFieldCount . Python Raw REST API Create an API object 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 apiObject = APIObject . creator ( # (1) name = \"api-object\" , # (2) connection_qualified_name = connection_qualified_name , # (3) api_field_count = 2 # (4) ) response = client . asset . save ( apiObject ) # (5) object_qualified_name = response . assets_created ( asset_type = APIObject )[ 0 ] . qualified_name # (6) Build up the minimum request to create an object. Provide a human-readable name for your object. Provide the qualified_name of the connection for this object. Provide the count of fields that exist in the object. Use None if no field exists in this object. Actually call Atlan to create the object. Retrieve the created object for use in subsequent creation calls.

POST /api/meta/entity/bulk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { \"entities\" : [ { \"typeName\" : \"APIObject\" , // (1) \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"api-object\" , // (2) \"qualifiedName\" : \"default/api/123456789/api-object\" , // (3) \"connectionQualifiedName\" : \"default/api/123456789\" , // (4) \"connectorName\" : \"api\" , // (5) \"apiFieldCount\" : 2 // (6) } } ] } The typeName must be exactly APIObject . Human-readable name for your object. The qualifiedName should follow the pattern: default/api/<epoch>/<objectName> , where default/api/<epoch> is the qualifiedName of the connection for this object and <objectName> is the name of this object. The connectionQualifiedName must be the exact qualifiedName of the connection for this object. The connectorName must be exactly api . The apiFieldCount should be the count of the fields present in the object. This is not a required attribute and can be excluded. APIQuery ¶ 2.5.3 An API query requires a name and a qualifiedName . For creation, you also need to specify the connectionQualifiedName of the connection for the query. Optionally, you can provide other attribute which enrich the query asset. Like apiInputFieldCount to store the count of input API fields in the query. apiQueryOutputType and apiQueryOutputTypeSecondary to store the query output types. If the query refers to an object in its output, it requires apiIsObjectReference and apiObjectQualifiedName to be populated. Python Raw REST API Create an API query 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 apiQuery = APIQuery . creator ( # (1) name = \"api-query\" , # (2) connection_qualified_name = connection_qualified_name , # (3) api_input_field_count = 2 , # (4) api_query_output_type = \"api-object-ref\" , # (5) api_query_output_type_secondary = \"Object\" , # (6) is_object_reference = True , # (7) reference_api_object_qualified_name = \"default/api/123456789/api-object-ref\" # (8) ) response = client . asset . save ( apiQuery ) # (9) query_qualified_name = response . assets_created ( asset_type = APIQuery )[ 0 ] . qualified_name # (10) Build up the minimum request to create a query. Provide a human-readable name for your query. Provide the qualified_name of the connection for this query. Provide the count of input fields that exist in the query. Use None if no input field exists in this query. Provide the primary type for the output of the query. E.g.: If Object/api-obj-ref, then api-obj-ref is primary. Provide the secondary type for the output of the query. E.g.: If Object/api-obj-ref, then Object is secondary. If the Output of the query refers to an object make it True or else False. If is_object_reference is True, provide the qualified name of the object this query refers to in output. Or None . Actually call Atlan to create the query.

The connectionQualifiedName must be the exact qualifiedName of the connection for this query. The connectorName must be exactly api . The apiInputFieldCount should be the count of the input fields present in the object. For no input fields, remove the attribute from the request. The apiQueryOutputType is the primary type for the output of the query. E.g.: If Object/api-obj-ref, then api-obj-ref is primary. The apiQueryOutputTypeSecondary is the secondary type for the output of the query. E.g.: If Object/api-obj-ref, then Object is secondary. The apiIsObjectReference should be true when the query refers to an object in its output. The apiObjectQualifiedName is the qualified name of the object this query refers to in its output. Remove attribute when apiIsObjectReference is false. APIField ¶ 2.5.3 An API field requires a name and a qualifiedName . For creation, you also need to specify the connectionQualifiedName of the connection for the field and either the apiObject or the apiQuery the field is in. Optionally, you can provide other attribute which enrich the field asset. Like apiFieldType and apiFieldTypeSecondary to store the field types. If the field refers to an object, it requires apiIsObjectReference and apiObjectQualifiedName to be populated.

Available relationships ¶ Every level of the API structure is an Asset , and can therefore be related to the following other assets. erDiagram Asset }o--o{ AtlasGlossaryTerm : meanings Asset ||--o{ Link : links Asset ||--o| Readme : readme Asset }o--o{ Process : inputToProcesses Asset }o--o{ Process : outputFromProcesses AtlasGlossaryTerm ¶ A glossary term provides meaning to an asset. The link terms to assets snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Link ¶ A link provides additional context to an asset, by providing a URL to additional information. Readme ¶ A README provides rich documentation for an asset. The add asset READMEs snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Process ¶ A process provides lineage information for an asset. An asset can be both an input and an output for one or more processes. The lineage snippets provide more detail on creating and working with lineage. Although if you want to delete everything in a connection, your better avenue is the packaged connection delete utility in the UI. ↩ Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

    "title": "Extending Atlan's model - Developer",
    "content": "Extending Atlan's model ¶ You can extend the metadata model in Atlan through its typedefs. Closed beta This feature is currently provided as a closed beta. Specific policies must be configured in your tenant to have the necessary access to create these extensions; without these operations these will not work. Further caveats When extending the Atlan data model, you should be aware of these additional restrictions: You can only manage definitions that are not in Atlan's internally-managed namespace, defined by the serviceType of each model. So if you want to extend an existing model, you should create a new type in your own serviceType and specify the model you want to extend as the supertype of that model. You should follow a naming convention that prefixes all attributes you define, to avoid potential future conflicts with Atlan-managed attributes. Create new struct models ¶ You can use structs to embed complex structures within other models. If you only intend to use primitive attributes, you do not need to define any structs. To create a new struct model: Java Create a new struct model 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 final String ATTR_PREFIX = \"myns\" ; List < AttributeDef > attrs = List . of ( // (1) AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"FieldOne\" , AtlanAttributeType . STRING ). build (), // (2) AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"FieldTwo\" , AtlanAttributeType . LONG ). build ()); StructDef sd = StructDef . creator ( \"SomeStruct\" , attrs ) // (3) . serviceType ( \"custom\" ) // (4) . build (); TypeDefResponse response = Atlan . getDefaultClient (). typeDefs . _create ( sd ); // (5) Begin by defining the list of attribute definitions for the struct model. Each attribute definition must have at least a name and a type. Define the struct model itself by providing at least a name and the list of attribute definitions. (Optional) You can also specify your own namespace for the model using serviceType . This will default to custom_extension if not specified. Call the _create() method to actually create the new struct model in Atlan. Create new entity models ¶ Entities define the metadata objects that Atlan can store, update, search, and so on. They can be made up of both primitive and struct-based (complex) attributes. To create a new entity model: Java Create a new entity model 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 List < AttributeDef > attrs = List . of ( // (1) AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"ParentAttrOne\" , AtlanAttributeType . STRING ). build (), AttributeDef . creator ( // (2) ATTR_PREFIX + \"ParentStructs\" , AtlanAttributeType . STRUCT , \"SomeStruct\" , AtlanCustomAttributeCardinality . SET ) // (3) . build ()); EntityDef ed = EntityDef . creator ( \"SomeParent\" , attrs ) . serviceType ( \"custom\" ) // (4) . build (); // (5) TypeDefResponse response = Atlan . getDefaultClient (). typeDefs . _create ( ed ); // (6) attrs = List . of ( AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"ChildAttrOne\" , AtlanAttributeType . LONG ). build (), AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"ChildAttrTwo\" , AtlanAttributeType . DATE ). build ()); ed = EntityDef . creator ( \"SomeChild\" , attrs ) . serviceType ( \"custom\" ) . build (); TypeDefResponse response = Atlan . getDefaultClient (). typeDefs . _create ( ed ); Begin by defining the list of attribute definitions for the entity model. Each attribute definition must have at least a name and a type. If the type is not primitive (in this example a struct), you must also specify the kind of object (struct). You can also override the cardinality, in this example we allow multiple embedded complex values against this single attribute. (Optional) You can also specify your own namespace for the model using serviceType . This will default to custom_extension if not specified. Define the entity model itself by providing at least a name and the list of attribute definitions. Call the _create() method to actually create the new entity model in Atlan. Create new relationship models ¶ Relationships define connections between entities. They must always have two entity model endpoints. To create a new relationship model: Java Create a new relationship model 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 List < AttributeDef > attrs = List . of ( // (1) AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"RelationshipAttrOne\" , AtlanAttributeType . STRING ). build (), // (2) AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"RelationshipAttrTwo\" , AtlanAttributeType . LONG ). build ()); RelationshipEndDef one = RelationshipEndDef . creator ( // (3) ATTR_PREFIX + \"Children\" , // (4) \"SomeParent\" , // (5) true , // (6) AtlanCustomAttributeCardinality . SET ) // (7) . build (); RelationshipEndDef two = RelationshipEndDef . creator ( // (8) ATTR_PREFIX + \"Parent\" , // (9) \"SomeChild\" , // (10) false , // (11) AtlanCustomAttributeCardinality . SINGLE ) // (12) . build (); RelationshipDef rd = RelationshipDef . creator ( RELATIONSHIP_DEF_NAME , one , two , attrs ) // (13) . relationshipCategory ( RelationshipCategory . AGGREGATION ) // (14) . serviceType ( \"custom\" ) // (15) . build (); TypeDefResponse response = Atlan . getDefaultClient (). typeDefs . _create ( rd ); // (16) (Optional) Begin by defining the list of attribute definitions for the relationship model. These are optional for a relationship, but are used to capture any attributes on each instance of the relationship. Each attribute definition must have at least a name and a type. If the type is not primitive (in this example a struct), you must also specify the kind of object (struct). Define each entity endpoint of the relationship. You must give the endpoint a name — this will be the name of the attribute that appears in the entity itself to represent this relationship. You must specify the type of entity this relationship exists on (where the attribute name above will appear). Specify whether the relationship on this entity \"contains\" the other entities. For parent-child relationships this should be true on the parent entity type, and false otherwise. Specify the cardinality of the relationship: in this example we allow multiple children to be related to the parent type. Since every relationship is between exactly two entities, create an endpoint for the other side of the relationship as well. As before, you must give the endpoint a name — this will be the name of the attribute that appears in the entity itself to represent this relationship. You must specify the type of entity this relationship exists on (where the attribute name above will appear). Since this example is the child referring to its parent, the child is not a container. Since this example is the child referring to a single parent, this end of the relationship's cardinality is singular. Define the relationship model itself by providing at least a name, the two endpoints, and (optionally) the list of attribute definitions. By default, a relationship will be created as an ASSOCIATION . You can override this with any of: ASSOCIATION : defines a peer-to-peer relationship between the entity endpoints. AGGREGATION : defines a relationship where one endpoint is logically the \"parent\" of another endpoint. This differs from the COMPOSITION by not cascading deletes to related entities. COMPOSITION : defines a relationship where one endpoint is strictly the \"parent\" of another endpoint. This differs from AGGREGATION because any removal of the entity at the parent end of the relationship will cascade to removing any of the related children entities as well. (Optional) You can also specify your own namespace for the model using serviceType . This will default to custom_extension if not specified. Call the _create() method to actually create the new entity model in Atlan. Update existing models ¶ Treat existing attributes as immutable You can also update existing entity models. However, in general you should only append (create new) attributes and not remove or attempt to change any existing attributes, or you may lose data from those existing attributes. To update an existing model, first retrieve it and then apply updates to it: Java Update an existing model 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 EntityDef parent = ( EntityDef ) Atlan . getDefaultClient (). typeDefs . get ( \"SomeParent\" ); // (1) parent = parent . toBuilder () // (2) . attributeDef ( AttributeDef . creator ( ATTR_PREFIX + \"ThirdAttribute\" , AtlanAttributeType . BOOLEAN ) // (3) . build ()) . typeVersion ( \"1.1\" ) // (4) . build (); TypeDefResponse response = Atlan . getDefaultClient (). typeDefs . _update ( parent ); // (5) Begin by retrieving the existing model's definition. You can convert the immutable object returned into a mutatable builder using the .toBuilder() method. Remember to assign the value back Remember to assign the built immutable value back to some variable, and use that variable in the next step. Otherwise the changes you make here will not be applied back. You can then append as many additional attributes as you like. You should also update the typeVersion of the model to the next minor version. Call the _update() method to actually update the existing model in Atlan. Was this page helpful?

    "content": "On this page Note that object tagging in Snowflake currently requires Enterprise Edition or higher . Atlan enables you to import your Snowflake tags , update your Snowflake assets with the imported tags, and push the tag updates back to Snowflake: Import tags - crawl Snowflake tags from Snowflake to Atlan Reverse sync - sync Snowflake tag updates from Atlan to Snowflake Once you've imported your Snowflake tags to Atlan: Your Snowflake assets in Atlan are automatically enriched with their Snowflake tags. Imported Snowflake tags are mapped to corresponding Atlan tags through case-insensitive name match - multiple Snowflake tags can be matched to a single tag in Atlan. You can also attach Snowflake tags , including tag values, to your Snowflake assets in Atlan - allowing you to categorize your assets at a more granular level. Atlan supports: Allowed values : attach an allowed value from a predefined list of values imported from Snowflake. Tag values: enter any value in Atlan while attaching or editing imported Snowflake tags on an asset. You can enable reverse sync to push any tag updates for your Snowflake assets back to Snowflake - including allowed and tag values added to assets in Atlan. You can filter your assets by Snowflake tags and tag and allowed values. Did you know? Enabling reverse sync only updates existing tags in Snowflake. It neither creates nor deletes any tags in Snowflake. Prerequisites ​ Did you know? Additional privileges are only required when using the information schema method for fetching metadata. This is because Snowflake stores all tag objects in the ACCOUNT_USAGE schema. If you're using the account usage method to crawl metadata in Atlan or you have configured the Snowflake miner , any permissions required are already set. Account usage method ​ Before you can import tags from Snowflake, you need to do the following: Create tags or have existing tags in Snowflake. Grant the same permissions as required for crawling Snowflake assets to import tags and push updated tags to Snowflake. Information schema method ​ Before you can import tags from Snowflake, you need to do the following: Create tags or have existing tags in Snowflake. Grant additional permissions to import tags from Snowflake. Grant additional permissions to push updated tags to Snowflake. Import Snowflake tags to Atlan ​ Who can do this? You need to be an admin user in Atlan to import Snowflake tags to Atlan. You also need to work with your Snowflake administrator to grant additional permissions to import tags from Snowflake - you may not have access yourself. You can import your Snowflake tags to Atlan through one-way tag sync. The synced Snowflake tags are matched to corresponding tags in Atlan through case-insensitive name match and your Snowflake assets are enriched with their synced tags from Snowflake. To import Snowflake tags to Atlan, you can either: Create a new Snowflake workflow and configure the crawler to import tags. Modify the crawler's configuration for an existing Snowflake workflow to change Import Tags to Yes . If you subsequently modify the workflow to disable tag import, for any tags already imported, Atlan preserves those tags. Once the crawler has completed running, tags imported from Snowflake are available to use for tagging assets! 🎉 View Snowflake tags in Atlan ​ Once you've imported your Snowflake tags, you can view and manage your Snowflake tags in Atlan. To view Snowflake tags: From the left menu of any screen, click Governance . Under the Governance heading of the _Governance cente_r, click Tags . (Optional) Under Tags , click the funnel icon to filter tags by source type. Click Snowflake to filter for tags imported from Snowflake. From the left menu under Tags , select a synced tag - synced tags display the Snowflake ❄️ icon next to the tag name. In the Overview section, you can view a total count of synced Snowflake tags. To the right of Overview , click Synced tags to view additional details - including tag name, description, tag values, total count of linked assets, connection, database, and schema names, and timestamp for last synced. (Optional) Click the Linked assets tab to view linked assets for your Snowflake tag. (Optional) In the top right, click the pencil icon to add a description and change the tag icon . You can't rename tags synced from Snowflake. Push tag updates to Snowflake ​ Who can do this? Any admin or member user in Atlan can configure reverse sync for tag updates to Snowflake. You also need to work with your Snowflake administrator to grant additional permissions to push updates - you may not have access yourself. Did you know? Reverse sync is currently only available for imported Snowflake tags in Atlan. The imported tags display a Snowflake ❄️ icon next to the tag name. If using the account usage method , expect a data latency of up to 3 hours for reverse tag sync to be successful. You can enable reverse sync for your imported Snowflake tags in Atlan and push all tag updates for your Snowflake assets back to source. Once you have enabled reverse sync, any Snowflake assets with tags updated in Atlan are also updated in Snowflake. To enable reverse sync for imported Snowflake tags: From the left menu of any screen, click Governance . Under the Governance heading of the _Governance cente_r, click Tags . (Optional) Under Tags , click the funnel icon to filter tags by source type. Click Snowflake to filter for tags imported from Snowflake. In the left menu under Tags , select a synced Snowflake tag - synced tags display the Snowflake ❄️ icon next to the tag name. On your selected tag page, to the right of Overview , click Synced tags . Under Synced tags , in the upper right, turn on Enable reverse sync to synchronize tag updates from Atlan to Snowflake. In the advanced settings, you can also enable concatenation to support multiple tag values for a single column. For detailed information about multiple tag values and concatenation, see Multiple tag values and concatenation . In the corresponding confirmation dialog, click Yes, enable it to enable reverse tag sync or click Cancel . Now when you attach Snowflake tags to your Snowflake assets in Atlan, these tag updates are also pushed to Snowflake! 🎉 Did you know? Enabling reverse sync won't trigger any updates in Snowflake until synced tags are attached to Snowflake assets in Atlan. For any questions about managing Snowflake tags, head over here .

Run looker-extractor ​ Crawl all Looker connections ​ To crawl all Looker connections using the looker-extractor tool: Log into the server with Docker Compose installed. Change to the directory containing the compose file. Run Docker Compose: sudo docker-compose up Crawl a specific connection ​ To crawl a specific Looker connection using the looker-extractor tool: Log into the server with Docker Compose installed. Change to the directory containing the compose file. Run Docker Compose: sudo docker-compose up <CONNECTION-NAME> (Replace <CONNECTION-NAME> with the name of the connection from the services section of the compose file.) (Optional) Review generated files ​ The looker-extractor tool will generate many JSON files for each service . For example: projects.json dashboards.json dashboard_tiles.json looks.json and many others You can inspect the metadata and make sure it is acceptable to provide the metadata to Atlan. Upload generated files to S3 ​ To provide Atlan access to the extracted metadata you will need to upload the metadata to an S3 bucket. Did you know? We recommend uploading to the same S3 bucket as Atlan uses to avoid access issues. Reach out to your Data Success Manager to get the details of your Atlan bucket. To create your own bucket, refer to the Create your own S3 bucket section of the dbt documentation. (The steps will be exactly the same.) To upload the metadata to S3: Ensure all files for a particular database have the same prefix. For example, metadata/looker/projects.json , metadata/looker/dashboards.json , etc. Upload the files to the S3 bucket using your preferred method. For example, to upload all files using the AWS CLI : aws s3 cp output/looker-example s3://my-bucket/metadata/looker-example --recursive Crawl metadata in Atlan ​ Once you have extracted metadata on-premises and uploaded the results to S3, you can crawl the metadata into Atlan: How to crawl Looker Be sure you select Offline for the Extraction method .

    "content": "GCSBucket ¶ Instance of a Google Cloud Storage bucket in Atlan. Complete reference This is a complete reference for the GCSBucket object in Atlan, showing every possible property and relationship that can exist for these objects. For an introduction, you probably want to start with: Snippets — small, atomic examples of single-step use cases. Patterns — walkthroughs of common multi-step implementation patterns. GCSBucket inherits its attributes and relationships from these other types: classDiagram direction RL class GCSBucket link GCSBucket \"../gcsbucket\" class GCS { <<abstract>> } link GCS \"../gcs\" GCS <|-- GCSBucket : extends class Google { <<abstract>> } link Google \"../google\" Google <|-- GCS : extends class Cloud { <<abstract>> } link Cloud \"../cloud\" Cloud <|-- Google : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- Cloud : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends class ObjectStore { <<abstract>> } link ObjectStore \"../objectstore\" ObjectStore <|-- GCS : extends class Catalog { <<abstract>> } link Catalog \"../catalog\" Catalog <|-- ObjectStore : extends class Asset { <<abstract>> } link Asset \"../asset\" Asset <|-- Catalog : extends class Referenceable { <<abstract>> } link Referenceable \"../referenceable\" Referenceable <|-- Asset : extends Properties ¶ Inherited properties These attributes are inherited from GCSBucket 's supertypes (shown above): typeName ¶ Type of this asset. guid ¶ Globally-unique identifier for this asset. classifications ¶ Tags assigned to the asset.

    "title": "What does Atlan crawl from Google BigQuery? | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page Once you have crawled Google BigQuery , you can use connector-specific filters for quick asset discovery. The following filters are currently supported for these assets: Tables - BigQuery labels and Is sharded filters Atlan doesn't run any table scans. Atlan leverages the table preview options from Google BigQuery that enable you to view data for free and without affecting any quotas using the tabledata.list API. Hence, table asset previews in Atlan are already cost-optimized. However, this doesn't apply to views and materialized views . For Google BigQuery views and materialized views , Atlan sends you a cost nudge before viewing a sample data preview. This informs you about the precise bytes that are spent during the execution of the query, helping you decide if you still want to run the preview. Did you know? You also receive a cost nudge before querying your Google BigQuery assets . Atlan crawls and maps the following assets and properties from Google BigQuery.

    "title": "Troubleshooting Tableau connectivity | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page What are the known limitations of the Tableau connector? ​ Atlan currently does not support the following: Crawling Tableau flows when using the JWT bearer authentication method , due to limitations at source. Crawling tags from Tableau. Cataloging Tableau Pulse, stories, and views. Parsing custom SQL queries, where all tables referenced (whether in the main query or subqueries) are considered as upstream lineage for the asset. Why does Atlan require the Site Administrator Explorer role in Tableau? ​ Atlan requires the Site Administrator Explorer role in Tableau to extract data source fields and calculated fields. It is not possible to fetch data source fields and calculated fields with the Viewer role in the current version of the Tableau Metadata API. Atlan uses this data to generate granular column-level lineage across data sources and SQL assets. To extract lineage for assets in Tableau, the user must have the Site Administrator Explorer role. Is lineage available for Tableau custom SQL data sources? ​ Yes, Atlan can parse custom SQL queries in Tableau to generate lineage between the data source and tables. Lineage is available for tables from all SQL sources. However, column-level lineage is currently not supported. Why is upstream lineage missing for Tableau data sources? ​ If your Tableau data source is in a paused state , the Tableau Metadata API may fail to provide the requisite metadata on source databases and tables for Atlan to generate upstream lineage. Restart your Tableau data source and ensure that it remains active while crawling Tableau . This will allow Atlan to fetch the requisite metadata to generate upstream lineage for data sources. Why is there a discrepancy in asset count between Tableau and Atlan? ​ Dashboards - the Tableau UI does not display a unique count of dashboards. Dashboards in Tableau are represented in collections of one or more views. These may have same names as the views but are independent objects. Hence, the total count of these views in Tableau does not match the dashboard count in Atlan. Atlan sources the dashboard count from the Tableau API, which is the only reliable way to fetch the dashboard count. Data sources - embedded data sources are not reported on the Tableau UI. However, in Atlan, data sources can be filtered to show only published data sources, which should match the count of data sources on the Tableau UI. Can users who do not have access to a dashboard still see the preview? ​ Users can only see asset previews if the following conditions are met: They have the necessary permissions in both Tableau and Atlan. They are logged into Atlan and Tableau on the same browser. Therefore, if a user lacks the permission to view a dashboard in Tableau, they will not be able to view the dashboard preview in Atlan. Even if they do have the necessary permissions, they will need to be logged into Tableau on the same browser as their Atlan instance for asset previews to work. Why can I not see previews for my Tableau assets? ​ Your Tableau assets will be updated with previews during the next run of your Tableau workflow. If you have run the workflow and still do not see the previews, we suggest you rerun the workflow. Once you've rerun the workflow, the previews should be visible to all eligible users. If you're using Tableau Server with clickjack protection enabled and your Tableau instance URL is of a different origin than the Atlan instance URL, the asset previews will not load due to a same-origin error from the browser. You will need to disable clickjack protection to allow the Tableau asset previews to load. Is the certified status in Tableau mapped to the certificates field in Atlan? ​ Yes, the isCertified status for published data sources in Tableau is mapped to the certificates field in Atlan. Is the owner field in Tableau mapped to the owners field in Atlan? ​ No, the asset owner in Tableau is displayed as the source owner in the Overview section of the asset sidebar in Atlan. This is also only available for Tableau projects , flows , workbooks , and published data sources . Tableau has retired metrics methods in API 3.22 , hence source owner attribute for metrics is not supported in Atlan. Why am I getting a \"still creating the Metadata API store\" error? ​ Error message: Still creating the Metadata API Store. Results from the query might be incomplete at this time. BACKFILL-RUNNING If your Tableau workflow is failing with the above error message, this is because the Tableau Metadata API is being re-indexed after a quarterly release. The re-indexing of the Metadata API after quarterly releases can take up to a week, depending on the size of your instance. Since Atlan uses the Tableau Metadata API to fetch metadata, your Tableau workflows in Atlan may fail if the re-indexing has not been completed. You can check the backfill status of the Tableau Metadata API Store following this guide . Learn more about common errors in your Metadata API query. How to debug test authentication and preflight check errors? ​ Incorrect hostname Unable to connect to the specified host. Please verify that the host details are correct and retry. Ensure that you have entered the hostname for your Tableau Online or Tableau Server instance correctly. If you're using a domain name, verify that the DNS name correctly resolves to the corresponding IP address. Connection timed out Unable to connect to Tableau instance. Please verify server port or check if your server is up and running. Ensure that you're using the correct port number, especially if using a custom port for Tableau Server. Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution - you can also test from a different network or device. SSL error Unable to connect. Please check your SSL setting. Ensure that the server URL uses https if SSL is enabled . If the connection does not require an SSL, use http instead. The ssl details provided are incorrect. Please provide correct ssl certs. If your Tableau Server instance uses a self-signed or an internal CA SSL certificate, enter the SSL certificate correctly in the recommended format . Incorrect port number Unable to connect to Tableau instance. Please verify server port and retry. Ensure that you're using the correct port number, especially if using a custom port for Tableau Server. Invalid personal access token The personal access token you provided is invalid. Please check your PAT name and token value. Ensure that you have entered the token name correctly and it matches the token generated in Tableau: Token name is case-sensitive. Ensure that there are no extra spaces or characters. If the token you provided is invalid, you can create a new token . Incorrect site details The site details provided are incorrect. Please provide correct site details. Confirm that the site name in the URL matches the exact case and spelling of the site you are trying to access. Site names in Tableau are case-sensitive. Incorrect username Provided username is incorrect. Please check. Confirm that the username is present in Tableau. Otherwise, you can add a new user for basic authentication . Incorrect client ID The client id provided is incorrect or site is empty or connected app in tableau is deleted. Please check and try again. Ensure that you have specified the site name if using JWT bearer authentication. Ensure that the connected app is present in Tableau and verify the client ID. Incorrect secret ID or value The secret id provided is incorrect or the secret value is deleted. Please check and try again. or The secret value provided is incorrect. Please check your secret value and try again. Verify the secret ID of the connected app . Ensure that the secret value of the connected app has not been deleted.",

Access policies Atlan creates the policies that grant access to a connection, including the ability to retrieve the connection and to create assets within it, asynchronously. It can take several seconds (even up to approximately 30 seconds) before these are in place after creating the connection. You may therefore need to wait before you'll be able to create the assets below within the connection. To confirm access, retrieve the connection after it has been created. The SDKs' retry loops will automatically retry until the connection can be successfully retrieved. At that point, your API token has permission to create the other assets. Note: if you are reusing an existing connection rather than creating one via your API token, you must give your API token a persona that has access to that connection. Otherwise all attempts to create, read, update, or delete assets within that connection will fail due to a lack of permissions.

Available relationships ¶ Every level of the business intelligence structure is an Asset , and can therefore be related to the following other assets. erDiagram Asset }o--o{ AtlasGlossaryTerm : meanings Asset ||--o{ Link : links Asset ||--o| Readme : readme Asset }o--o{ Process : inputToProcesses Asset }o--o{ Process : outputFromProcesses AtlasGlossaryTerm ¶ A glossary term provides meaning to an asset. The link terms to assets snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Link ¶ A link provides additional context to an asset, by providing a URL to additional information. Readme ¶ A README provides rich documentation for an asset. The add asset READMEs snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Process ¶ A process provides lineage information for an asset. An asset can be both an input and an output for one or more processes. The lineage snippets provide more detail on creating and working with lineage. Although if you want to delete everything in a connection, your better avenue is the packaged connection delete utility in the UI. ↩ Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

    "title": "Set up client credentials flow | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page Important Atlan currently supports Salesforce Sales Cloud and Financial Services Cloud (FSC). Atlan supports the Salesforce OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow for server-to-server integration. This flow enables Atlan to authenticate using a dedicated integration user and an external client app in Salesforce, providing secure, non-interactive access to Salesforce metadata and data for crawling. Prerequisites ​ Before you begin, make sure you have: Salesforce administrator access Network connectivity between Atlan and your Salesforce instance Create custom profile ​ A custom profile defines the specific permissions and access levels for your integration user. You'll create this profile with the minimum necessary permissions for Atlan to crawl your Salesforce data securely. Create a custom profile to manage permissions for the integration user: From Setup , enter profiles in the Quick Find box and select Profiles . Click New Profile . Select Standard User from the Existing Profile dropdown to clone. Enter a name, for example AtlanIntegrationProfile . Click Save . On the new profile page, click Edit . Under Connected App Access , check the External Client App you create. Under Administrative Permissions , uncheck all except: API Enabled View All Data Run Reports Under Standard Object Permissions and Custom Object Permissions , select Read and View All for all items. Click Save . Create integration user ​ The integration user acts as the identity that Atlan uses to connect to Salesforce. This dedicated user ensures secure, auditable access separate from individual user accounts. Create a dedicated Salesforce user for the external client app: From Setup , expand Administration → Users and click Users . Click New User . Enter required details: First Name , Last Name , Username , Email , Nickname . Select Salesforce for User License . Assign the custom profile created in the previous step. Click Save . Create external client app ​ The external client app provides the OAuth infrastructure for secure server-to-server authentication. This app generates the credentials that Atlan uses to authenticate without requiring user interaction. Set up the external client app for client credentials flow: From Setup , enter external client app manager in Quick Find and select External Client App Manager . Click New External Client App . Enter: External Client App Name : for example, AtlanIntegration Contact Email : your email Distribution State : Local Expand API (Enable OAuth Settings) : Check Enable OAuth Set Callback URL : https://localhost (placeholder, unused) Move the following scopes to Selected OAuth Scopes : Manage user data via APIs (api) Perform requests at any time (refresh_token, offline_access) Access Lightning applications (lightning) Under Flow Enablement , check Enable Client Credentials Flow . Enable: Require Secret for Web Server Flow Require Secret for Refresh Token Flow Optional hardening: Require Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) Enable Refresh Token Rotation Issue JSON Web Token (JWT)-based access tokens Click Create . On the app details page, copy the Consumer Key (Client ID) and Consumer Secret from OAuth Settings . Store these credentials securely—they're required to configure the Atlan connection. Configure policies ​ After creating the external client app, you need to configure its security policies. These policies control which users and profiles can access the app and define the authentication flow settings. From External Client App Manager , locate your app and click Edit . Open the Policies tab. Set Start Page to None . Move the integration custom profile to Selected Profiles . If using permission sets, move relevant sets to Selected Permission Sets . In OAuth Policies , set: Permitted Users : Admin approved users are pre-authorized OAuth Start URL : leave blank unless required In OAuth Flows and External Client App Enhancements : Check Enable Client Credentials Flow Run As (Username) : enter the integration user username Set additional policies as required (IP Relaxation, Session Timeout, Refresh Token Policy) Click Save . Troubleshooting ​ If you encounter issues with Client Credentials authentication, see Troubleshooting Salesforce Connectivity . Next steps ​ Crawl Salesforce to configure the connection in Atlan. Prerequisites Create custom profile Create integration user Create external client app Troubleshooting Next steps",

Note that the values here are the username(s) of the user(s). At least one of adminRoles , adminGroups , or adminUsers must be provided. Access policies Atlan creates the policies that grant access to a connection, including the ability to retrieve the connection and to create assets within it, asynchronously. It can take several seconds (even up to approximately 30 seconds) before these are in place after creating the connection. You may therefore need to wait before you'll be able to create the assets below within the connection. To confirm access, retrieve the connection after it has been created. The SDKs' retry loops will automatically retry until the connection can be successfully retrieved. At that point, your API token has permission to create the other assets. Note: if you are reusing an existing connection rather than creating one via your API token, you must give your API token a persona that has access to that connection. Otherwise all attempts to create, read, update, or delete assets within that connection will fail due to a lack of permissions.

Available relationships ¶ Every level of the business intelligence structure is an Asset , and can therefore be related to the following other assets. erDiagram Asset }o--o{ AtlasGlossaryTerm : meanings Asset ||--o{ Link : links Asset ||--o| Readme : readme Asset }o--o{ Process : inputToProcesses Asset }o--o{ Process : outputFromProcesses AtlasGlossaryTerm ¶ A glossary term provides meaning to an asset. The link terms to assets snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Link ¶ A link provides additional context to an asset, by providing a URL to additional information. Readme ¶ A README provides rich documentation for an asset. The add asset READMEs snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Process ¶ A process provides lineage information for an asset. An asset can be both an input and an output for one or more processes. The lineage snippets provide more detail on creating and working with lineage.

Replace <account_id> with your AWS account ID. Configure user-based authentication ​ Using the IAM policy created above, configure user-based authentication. To configure user-based authentication: Create an AWS IAM user by following the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . On the Set permissions page, attach the policy created in the previous step to this user. Once the user is created, view or download the user's access key ID and secret access key . danger This will be your only opportunity to view or download the access keys.

    "title": "Set up on-premises Looker access | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page Who can do this? You will need access to a machine that can run Docker on-premises. You will also need your Looker access details, including credentials. In some cases you won't be able to expose your Looker instance for Atlan to crawl and ingest metadata. For example, this may happen when security requirements restrict access to sensitive, mission-critical data. In such cases you may want to decouple the extraction of metadata from its ingestion in Atlan. This approach gives you full control over your resources and metadata transfer to Atlan. Prerequisites ​ To extract metadata from your on-premises Looker instance you will need to use Atlan's looker-extractor tool. Did you know? Atlan uses exactly the same looker-extractor behind the scenes when it connects to Looker in the cloud. Install Docker Compose ​ Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running applications composed of many Docker containers. (Any guesses where the name came from? 😉) To install Docker Compose: Install Docker Install Docker Compose Did you know? Instructions provided in this documentation should be enough even if you are completely new to Docker and Docker Compose. But you can also walk through the Get started with Docker Compose tutorial if you want to learn Docker Compose basics first. Get the looker-extractor tool ​ To get the looker-extractor tool: Raise a support ticket to get a link to the latest version. Download the image using the link provided by support. Load the image to the server you'll use to crawl Looker: sudo docker load -i /path/to/looker-extractor-master.tar Get the compose file ​ Atlan provides you with a configuration file for the looker-extractor tool. This is a Docker compose file . To get the compose file: Download the latest compose file . Save the file to an empty directory on the server you'll use to access your on-premises databases. The file is docker-compose.yaml . Define Looker connections ​ The structure of the compose file includes three main sections: x-templates contains configuration fragments. You should ignore this section - do not make any changes to it. services is where you will define your Looker connections. volumes contains mount information. You should ignore this section as well - do not make any changes to it. Define services ​ For each on-premises Looker instance, define an entry under services in the compose file. Each entry will have the following structure: services: CONNECTION-NAME: <<: *extract environment: <<: *looker-defaults INCLUDE_PROJECTS: \"project1,project2\" USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE: \"true\" volumes: - ./output/looker-example:/output/process Replace CONNECTION-NAME with the name of your connection. <<: *extract tells the looker-extractor tool to run. environment contains all parameters for the tool. Replaces the values given for INCLUDE_PROJECTS with the names of your own Looker projects you want to extract. Separate each project name by a comma. volumes specifies where to store results. In this example, the extractor will store results in the ./output/looker-example folder on the local file system. You can add as many Looker connections as you want. Did you know? Docker's documentation describes the services format in more detail. Provide credentials ​ To define the credentials for your Looker connections you will need to provide: A Looker SDK configuration file A private key to access your git repository via ssh (to extract field-level lineage) A passphrase to decipher the private key (to extract field-level lineage) The Looker metadata includes the git repo locations. The Looker SDK configuration is a .ini file with the following format: [Looker] # Base URL for your looker instance API. Do not include /api/* in the URL. base_url=https://<host>:<port> # API 3 client id client_id=YourClientID # API 3 client secret client_secret=YourClientSecret verify_ssl=True Secure credentials ​ Using local files ​ danger If you decide to keep Looker credentials in plaintext files, we recommend you restrict access to the directory and the compose file. For extra security, we recommend you use Docker secrets to store the sensitive passwords. To specify the local files in your compose file: secrets: looker_config: file: ./looker.ini looker_git_private_key: file: ./id_ed25519 looker_git_private_key_passphrase: file: ./passphrase.txt danger This secrets section is at the same top-level as the services section described earlier. It is not a sub-section of the services section. Using Docker secrets ​ To create and use Docker secrets: Store the Looker SDK configuration file: sudo docker secret create looker_config path/to/looker.ini At the top of your compose file, add a secrets element to access your secret: secrets: looker_config: external: true name: looker_config The name should be the same one you used in the docker secret create command above. Once stored as a Docker secret, you can remove the local Looker SDK configuration file. info 💪 Did you know? You can use the same steps to create Docker secrets for your git details, as well. Replace the name ( looker_config ) and path to the file, but otherwise run the same command. Within the service section of the compose file, add a new secrets element and specify the name of the secret within your service to use it. Example ​ Let's explain in detail with an example: secrets: looker_config: external: true name: looker_config looker_git_private_key: file: ./id_ed25519 looker_git_private_key_passphrase: external: true name: looker_git_private_key_passphrase x-templates: # ... services: my-looker: <<: *extract environment: <<: *looker-defaults INCLUDE_PROJECTS: \"project1,project2\" USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE: \"true\" volumes: - ./output/looker-example:/output/process secrets: - looker_config - looker_git_private_key - looker_git_private_key_passphrase volumes: jars: In this example we've defined the secrets at the top of the file (you could also define them at the bottom): looker_config refers to an external Docker secret created using the docker secret create command. looker_git_private_key refers to a local file. looker_git_private_key_passphrase refers to an external Docker secret created using the docker secret create command. The name of this service is my-looker . You can use any meaningful name you want. The <<: *looker-defaults sets the connection type to Looker. INCLUDE_PROJECTS tells the extractor to only extract project1 and project2 from Looker. USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE tells the extractor to extract field-level lineage. This means the git private key information is also required. The ./output/looker-example:/output/process line tells the extractor where to store results. In this example, the extractor will store results in the ./output/looker-example directory on the local file system. We recommend you output metadata for different connections in separate directories. The secrets section within services tells the extractor which secrets to use for this service. Each of these refers to the name of a secret listed at the beginning of the compose file. Prerequisites Get the compose file Define Looker connections Provide credentials Secure credentials Example",

    "content": "End-to-end bulk update ¶ Running example To walk through this using an example, and to compare and contrast the approaches, imagine you want to: Mark all views (including materialized views) in a particular schema as verified, unless they already have some certificate. Change the owner of the same views. Step-by-step ¶ The usual end-to-end pattern for updating many assets efficiently involves three steps: Finding the assets you want to update. Applying your updates to each asset (in-memory). Sending those changes to Atlan (in batches). You can do each of these steps in sequence, for example: 1. Find the assets ¶ 1.4.0 1.1.0 You start by first finding the assets you want to update. This is usually best done through a search . (For other common examples, have a look at the search snippets .) Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Example: get all views in a schema 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 String schemaQN = \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH\" ; // (1) IndexSearchRequest findViews = client . assets . select () // (2) . where ( Asset . QUALIFIED_NAME . startsWith ( schemaQN )) // (3) . where ( Asset . TYPE_NAME . in ( List . of ( View . TYPE_NAME , MaterializedView . TYPE_NAME ))) // (4) . whereNot ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS . hasAnyValue ()) // (5) . pageSize ( 100 ) // (6) . includeOnResults ( Asset . DESCRIPTION ) // (7) . includeOnResults ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS ) . includeOnResults ( Asset . OWNER_USERS ) . toRequest (); // (8) IndexSearchResponse response = findViews . search (); // (9) The qualifiedName of every view starts with the qualifiedName of its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using the qualifiedName . To start building up a query with multiple conditions, you can use the select() helper on any client's assets member. You can chain where() methods to define all the conditions the search results must match. You can use the static constants within any given type to select a particular attribute (like QUALIFIED_NAME in this example), and then limit results to only those assets whose qualifiedName starts with the qualifiedName of the schema (by using the startsWith() predicate). In this example, that means only assets that are within this particular schema will be returned as results. Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use the Asset.TYPE_NAME.in() method to restrict results to only views and materialized views. Since you only want to update views that do not already have a certificate, you can further limit the results using the whereNot() method. This will exclude any assets where a certificate already hasAnyValue() . Here you can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page. Add as many attributes as needed. Each attribute you add here will ensure that detail is included in each search result. So in this example, every view will include its description, certificate, and individual owners. (Limit these attributes to the minimum you need about each view to do your intended work.) You can translate the object you've built up into various outputs, for example immediately calculating a count of how many results match or streaming them directly for processing. In this case, the toRequest() method will give us the resulting set of criteria back as a complete index search request. You can then execute the search based on the request. Example: get all views in a schema 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.client.asset import Batch from pyatlan.errors import AtlanError from pyatlan.model.enums import CertificateStatus from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import CompoundQuery , FluentSearch from pyatlan.model.assets import Asset , View , MaterialisedView client = AtlanClient () schema_qualified_name = \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH\" # (1) find_views = ( FluentSearch () # (2) . where ( Asset . QUALIFIED_NAME . startswith ( schema_qualified_name )) # (3) . where ( CompoundQuery . asset_types ([ View , MaterialisedView ])) # (4) . where ( CompoundQuery . active_assets ()) . where_not ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS . has_any_value ()) # (5) . page_size ( 100 ) # (6) . include_on_results ( Asset . DESCRIPTION ) # (7) . include_on_results ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS ) . include_on_results ( Asset . OWNER_USERS ) ) . to_request () # (8) response = client . asset . search ( find_views ) # (9) The qualified_name of every view starts with the qualified_name of its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using the qualified_name . To start building up a query with multiple conditions, you can use a FluentSearch() object. You can chain where() methods to define all the conditions the search results must match. You can use the class variables within any given type to select a particular attribute (like QUALIFIED_NAME in this example), and then limit results to only those assets whose qualified_name starts with the qualified_name of the schema (by using the startswith() predicate). In this example, that means only assets that are within this particular schema will be returned as results. Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use the CompoundQuery.asset_types() helper method to restrict results to only views and materialized views. Since you only want to update views that do not already have a certificate, you can further limit the results using the where_not() method. This will exclude any assets where a certificate already has_any_value() . Here you can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page. Add as many attributes as needed. Each attribute you add here will ensure that detail is included in each search result. So in this example, every view will include its description, certificate, and individual owners. (Limit these attributes to the minimum you need about each view to do your intended work.) You can translate the object you've built up into various outputs, for example immediately calculating a count of how many results match or executing the query to start processing results directly. In this case, the to_request() method will give us the resulting set of criteria back as a complete index search request. You can then execute the search based on the request. Example: get all views in a schema 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 val schemaQN = \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH\" // (1) val findViews = client . assets . select () // (2) . where ( Asset . QUALIFIED_NAME . startsWith ( schemaQN )) // (3) . where ( Asset . TYPE_NAME . `in` ( listOf ( View . TYPE_NAME , MaterializedView . TYPE_NAME ))) // (4) . whereNot ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS . hasAnyValue ()) // (5) . pageSize ( 100 ) // (6) . includeOnResults ( Asset . DESCRIPTION ) // (7) . includeOnResults ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS ) . includeOnResults ( Asset . OWNER_USERS ) . toRequest () // (8) val response = findViews . search () // (9) The qualifiedName of every view starts with the qualifiedName of its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using the qualifiedName . To start building up a query with multiple conditions, you can use the select() helper on any client's assets member. You can chain where() methods to define all the conditions the search results must match. You can use the static constants within any given type to select a particular attribute (like QUALIFIED_NAME in this example), and then limit results to only those assets whose qualifiedName starts with the qualifiedName of the schema (by using the startsWith() predicate). In this example, that means only assets that are within this particular schema will be returned as results. Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use the Asset.TYPE_NAME.in() helper method to restrict results to only views and materialized views. Since you only want to update views that do not already have a certificate, you can further limit the results using the whereNot() method. This will exclude any assets where a certificate already hasAnyValue() . Here you can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page.

POST /api/meta/search/indexsearch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 { \"dsl\" : { // (1) \"query\" : { \"bool\" : { // (2) \"filter\" : [ // (3) { \"prefix\" : { // (4) \"qualifiedName\" : { \"value\" : \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH\" } } }, { \"terms\" : { // (5) \"__typeName.keyword\" : [ \"View\" , \"MaterialisedView\" ] } }, { \"term\" : { // (6) \"__state\" : { \"value\" : \"ACTIVE\" } } } ], \"must_not\" : [ // (7) { \"exists\" : { \"field\" : \"certificateStatus\" } } ] } }, \"sort\" : [ // (8) { \"__guid\" : { \"order\" : \"asc\" } } ], \"from\" : 0 , // (9) \"size\" : 100 , \"track_total_hits\" : true }, \"attributes\" : [ // (10) \"description\" , \"certificateStatus\" , \"ownerUsers\" ], \"suppressLogs\" : true , \"showSearchScore\" : false , \"excludeMeanings\" : false , \"excludeClassifications\" : false } Run a search to find the views and materialized views. To start building up a query with multiple conditions, you can use a bool query in Elasticsearch. You can use the filter criteria to define all the conditions the search results must match in a binary way (either matches or doesn't). This avoids the need to calculate a score for each result. The qualifiedName of every view starts with the qualifiedName of its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using the qualifiedName . Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use an exact match on multiple types to restrict results to only views and materialized views. Searches by default will return all assets that are found — whether active or archived (soft-deleted). In most cases, you probably only want the active ones. Since you only want to update views that do not already have a certificate, you can further limit the results using the must_not clause. This will exclude any assets that already have a certificate present. When paging through results, you should specify a sort to give a stable set of results across pages. The most reliable sort will be by GUID of the asset, as this is guaranteed to be unique for every asset. Here you can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page. Add as many attributes as needed. Each attribute you add here will ensure that detail is included in each search result. So in this example, every view will include its description, certificate, and individual owners. (Limit these attributes to the minimum you need about each column to do your intended work.) 2. Build-up your changes ¶ 3.0.0 1.10.5 Next, you iterate through those results and make the changes you want to each one. Use the multiple operations pattern to make multiple changes to each asset. Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Example: iterate through results and make changes 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 AssetBatch batch = new AssetBatch ( client , 20 ); // (1) try { for ( Asset result : response ) { // (2) Asset revised = result . trimToRequired () // (3) . certificateStatus ( CertificateStatus . VERIFIED ) // (4) . ownerUser ( \"jsmith\" ) . build (); batch . add ( revised ); // (5) } Create a batch of assets to build-up the changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself. The first parameter defines the Atlan tenant on which the batch will be processed The second specifies the maximum number of assets to build-up before sending them across to Atlan Additional parameters By default (using only the options above) no classifications or custom metadata will be added or changed on the assets in each batch. To also include classifications and custom metadata, you need to use these additional parameters: A third parameter of true to replace all classifications on the assets in the batch, which would include removing classifications if none are provided for the assets in the batch itself (or false if you still want to ignore classifications) A fourth parameter to control how custom metadata should be handled for the assets: IGNORE any custom metadata changes in the batch, OVERWRITE to replace all custom metadata with what's provided in the batch (including removing custom metadata that already exists on an asset), or MERGE to only add or update custom metadata based on what's in the batch (leaving other existing custom metadata unchanged) a fifth parameter to control whether failures should be captured across batches ( true ) or ignored ( false ) a sixth parameter to control whether the batch should only attempt to update assets that already exist ( true ) or also create assets if they do not yet exist ( false ) a seventh parameter to control whether details about each created and updated asset across batches should be tracked ( true ) or ignored ( false ) — counts will always be kept an eighth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done in a case-insensitive way ( true ) or case-sensitively ( false ) a ninth parameter to control what kind of assets to create, if not running in updateOnly mode: partial assets (only available in lineage), or full assets a tenth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done strictly according to the data type specified ( false ), or if tables, views and materialized views should be treated interchangeably ( true ) This is the pattern for iterating through all results (across pages) covered in the Searching for assets portion of the SDK documentation. Every asset implements the trimToRequired() method, which gives you a builder containing only the bare minimum information needed to update that asset. Limit your asset to only what you intend to update When you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request — leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan. By using trimToRequired() you can remove all information you do not want to update, and then chain on only the details you do want to update. In this running example, you are updating the certificate to verified and setting a new owner — so you simply chain those updates onto the trimmed builder. You can then add your (in-memory) modified asset to the batch. Auto-saves as it goes As long as the number of assets built-up is below the maximum batch size specified when creating the batch, this will simply continue to build up the batch. As soon as you hit the size limit for the batch, though, this same method will call the save() operation to batch-update all of those assets in a single API call. Remember to flush Since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up, when the size of the queue did not yet reach the full batch size. Example: iterate through results and make changes 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 batch = Batch ( # (1) client = client , max_size = 20 , replace_atlan_tags = False , custom_metadata_handling = CustomMetadataHandling . IGNORE , capture_failures = False , update_only = False , track = False , case_insensitive = False , table_view_agnostic = False , creation_handling = AssetCreationHandling . FULL , ) try : for asset in response : # (2) revised = asset . trim_to_required () # (3) revised . certificate_status = CertificateStatus . VERIFIED # (4) revised . owner_users = { \"jsmith\" } batch . add ( asset ) # (5) Create a batch of assets to accumulate changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself. The Batch() takes the following parameters: client : an instance of AssetClient . max_size : the maximum size of each batch to be processed (per API call). Additional optional parameters By default (using only the options above) no classifications or custom metadata will be added or changed on the assets in each batch. To also include classifications and custom metadata, you need to use these additional parameters: replace_atlan_tags ( default: False ): If True replace all classifications (tags) on the assets in the batch, which would include removing classifications (tags) if none are provided for the assets in the batch itself (or False if you still want to ignore classifications) custom_metadata_handling ( default: CustomMetadataHandling.IGNORE ): control how custom metadata should be handled for the assets: IGNORE any custom metadata changes in the batch, OVERWRITE to replace all custom metadata with what's provided in the batch (including removing custom metadata that already exists on an asset), or MERGE to only add or update custom metadata based on what's in the batch (leaving other existing custom metadata unchanged) capture_failures ( default: False ): control whether failures should be captured across batches ( True ) or ignored ( False ) update_only ( default: False ): control whether the batch should only attempt to update assets that already exist ( True ) or also create assets if they do not yet exist ( False ) track ( default: False ): control whether details about each created and updated asset across batches should be tracked ( True ) or ignored ( False ) — counts will always be kept case_insensitive ( default: False ): control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done in a case-insensitive way ( True ) or case-sensitively ( False ) creation_handling ( default: AssetCreationHandling.FULL ): control what kind of assets to create, if not running in update_only mode; PARTIAL assets (only available in lineage), or FULL assets table_view_agnostic ( default: False ): control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done strictly according to the data type specified ( False ), or if tables, views and materialized views should be treated interchangeably ( True ) This is the pattern for iterating through all results (across pages) covered in the Searching for assets portion of the SDK documentation.

You can then add your (in-memory) modified asset to the batch. Auto-saves as it goes As long as the number of assets built-up is below the maximum batch size specified when creating the batch, this will simply continue to build up the batch.

Remember to flush Since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up, when the size of the queue did not yet reach the full batch size. Up to your own code There are no API calls to make to change the results in-memory. How you implement this will be entirely up to how you are writing your code. 3. Save them in batches ¶ 3.0.0 1.1.0 Finally, send the changes you have queued up in batches. Use the multiple assets pattern to update multiple assets at the same time. Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Example: save the changes in batches 22 23 24 25 batch . flush (); // (1) } catch ( AtlanException e ) { // (2) } The AssetBatch 's add() method used in the previous step will automatically save as its internal queue of assets reaches a full batch size. Remember to flush However, since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up. Both the .add() and .flush() operations of the AssetBatch could send a request over to Atlan. Either can therefore also run into trouble and raise an error through an AtlanException . It is up to you to handle such potential errors as you see fit. Example: save the changes in batches 30 31 32 batch . flush () # (1) except AtlanError as err : ... # (2) The Batch 's add() method used in the previous step will automatically save as its internal queue of assets reaches a full batch size. Remember to flush However, since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up. Both the .add() and .flush() operations of the Batch could send a request over to Atlan. Either can therefore also run into trouble and raise an error through an AtlanError . It is up to you to handle such potential errors as you see fit. Example: save the changes in batches 22 23 24 25 batch . flush () // (1) } catch ( e : AtlanException ) { // (2) } The AssetBatch 's add() method used in the previous step will automatically save as its internal queue of assets reaches a full batch size.

Both the .add() and .flush() operations of the AssetBatch could send a request over to Atlan. Either can therefore also run into trouble and raise an error through an AtlanException . It is up to you to handle such potential errors as you see fit. POST /api/meta/entity/bulk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 { \"entities\" : [ // (1) { \"typeName\" : \"View\" , // (2) \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"VIEW1\" , // (3) \"qualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH/VIEW1\" , \"certificateStatus\" : \"VERIFIED\" , // (4) \"ownerUsers\" : [ \"jsmith\" ] } }, { // (5) \"typeName\" : \"MaterialisedView\" , \"attributes\" : { \"name\" : \"MVIEW2\" , \"qualifiedName\" : \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH/MVIEW2\" , \"certificateStatus\" : \"VERIFIED\" , \"ownerUsers\" : [ \"jsmith\" ] } } ] } All details must still be included in an outer entities array. You need to specify the type for each asset you are updating. You need to specify other required attributes for each asset, such as its name and qualifiedName. Add on any other attributes or relationships you want to set on the asset, such as in the running example a verified certificate and new individual owner. Add another object to the payload to represent another asset that should be updated by the same API call. Once again specify all the required information for that kind of asset, and any of the details for attributes or relationships you want to set. Pipelining ¶ 3.0.0 1.10.5 Alternatively, when using an SDK, you can pipeline these operations together. The pipeline will run just as efficiently as the step-by-step approach above: Pushing down the criteria to run as a search on Atlan Lazily-fetching each page of results Batching up and bulk-saving changes Java Python Kotlin Raw REST API Example: pipelining 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 String schemaQN = \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH\" ; // (1) try ( ParallelBatch batch = new ParallelBatch ( client , 20 )) { // (2) client . assets . select () // (3) . where ( Asset . QUALIFIED_NAME . startsWith ( schemaQN )) // (4) . where ( Asset . TYPE_NAME . in ( List . of ( View . TYPE_NAME , MaterializedView . TYPE_NAME ))) // (5) . whereNot ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS . hasAnyValue ()) // (6) . pageSize ( 100 ) // (7) . includeOnResults ( Asset . DESCRIPTION ) // (8) . includeOnResults ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS ) . includeOnResults ( Asset . OWNER_USERS ) . stream ( true ) // (9) . forEach ( result -> { // (10) try { batch . add ( result . trimToRequired () // (11) . certificateStatus ( CertificateStatus . VERIFIED ) // (12) . ownerUser ( \"jsmith\" ) . build ()); // (13) } catch ( AtlanException e ) { // (14) log . error ( \"Unable to update: {}\" , result . getQualifiedName ()); } }); batch . flush (); // (15) log . info ( \"Created: {}\" , batch . getCreated (). size ()); log . info ( \"Updated: {}\" , batch . getUpdated (). size ()); } The qualifiedName of every view starts with the qualifiedName of its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using the qualifiedName . Create a batch of assets to build-up the changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself. When parallel-processing (see further notes on the stream(true) ) you need to use a parallel-capable ParallelBatch : The first parameter defines the Atlan tenant on which the batch will be processed The second specifies the maximum number of assets to build-up before sending them across to Atlan Additional parameters By default (using only the options above) no classifications or custom metadata will be added or changed on the assets in each batch. To also include classifications and custom metadata, you need to use these additional parameters: A third parameter of true to replace all classifications on the assets in the batch, which would include removing classifications if none are provided for the assets in the batch itself (or false if you still want to ignore classifications) A fourth parameter to control how custom metadata should be handled for the assets: IGNORE any custom metadata changes in the batch, OVERWRITE to replace all custom metadata with what's provided in the batch (including removing custom metadata that already exists on an asset), or MERGE to only add or update custom metadata based on what's in the batch (leaving other existing custom metadata unchanged) a fifth parameter to control whether failures should be captured across batches ( true ) or ignored ( false ) a sixth parameter to control whether the batch should only attempt to update assets that already exist ( true ) or also create assets if they do not yet exist ( false ) a seventh parameter to control whether details about each created and updated asset across batches should be tracked ( true ) or ignored ( false ) — counts will always be kept an eighth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done in a case-insensitive way ( true ) or case-sensitively ( false ) a ninth parameter to control what kind of assets to create, if not running in updateOnly mode: partial assets (only available in lineage), or full assets a tenth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done strictly according to the data type specified ( false ), or if tables, views and materialized views should be treated interchangeably ( true ) You can then start defining a pipeline directly against the client's assets by using the select() method. Including archived (soft-deleted) assets Searches by default will return all assets that are found — whether active or archived (soft-deleted). In most cases, you probably only want the active ones, so this is the default behavior of select() . Sending in true to this select() method will start the pipeline to include any archived (soft-deleted) assets in the results, if you do want them. You can chain as many where() methods as you want to define all the conditions the search results must match. You can use the static constants within any given type to select a particular attribute (like QUALIFIED_NAME in this example), and then limit results to only those assets whose qualifiedName starts with the qualifiedName of the schema (by using the startsWith() predicate). In this example, that means only assets that are within this particular schema will be returned as results. Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use the Asset.TYPE_NAME.in() method to restrict results to only views and materialized views. Since you only want to update views that do not already have a certificate, you can further limit the results using the whereNot() method. This will exclude any assets where a certificate already hasAnyValue() . (Optional) You can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page. Add as many attributes as needed. Each attribute you add here will ensure that detail is included in each search result. So in this example, every view will include its description, certificate, and individual owners. (Limit these attributes to the minimum you need about each view to do your intended work.) Once you have defined the criteria for your pipeline, call the stream() method to push-down the pipeline to Atlan. This will: Create a search that combines all the criteria you have specified. Run that search against Atlan to produce the first page of results. Page through the results by lazily fetching each subsequent page as you iterate through them. (So if you use a limit() on the stream, for example, you can break out before retrieving all pages.) Can also run in parallel threads You can also parallel-stream the results by passing true to the stream() method. This will spawn multiple threads that each independently process a page of results and combine the results in parallel. While this can be significantly faster for processing many results, keep in mind if you are collecting the results into any structure that structure must be thread-safe. (For example, you'll need to use things like ConcurrentHashMap rather than just HashMap , and to use ParallelBatch rather than AssetBatch if making changes.) For each result, you can then carry out your changes and submit them into the batch. Every asset implements the trimToRequired() method, which gives you a builder containing only the bare minimum information needed to update that asset. Limit your asset to only what you intend to update When you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request — leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan. By using trimToRequired() you can remove all information you do not want to update, and then chain on only the details you do want to update. In this running example, you are updating the certificate to verified and setting a new owner — so you simply chain those updates onto the trimmed builder. You can then add your (in-memory) modified asset to the batch. Auto-saves as it goes As long as the number of assets built-up is below the maximum batch size specified when creating the batch, this will simply continue to build up the batch. As soon as you hit the size limit for the batch, though, this same method will call the save() operation to batch-update all of those assets in a single API call. Remember to flush Since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up, when the size of the queue did not yet reach the full batch size. Both the .add() and .flush() operations of the AssetBatch could send a request over to Atlan. Either can therefore also run into trouble and raise an error through an AtlanException . It is up to you to handle such potential errors as you see fit. The AssetBatch 's add() method used in the previous step will automatically save as its internal queue of assets reaches a full batch size. Remember to flush However, since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up. Example: pipelining 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 import logging from pyatlan.client.atlan import AtlanClient from pyatlan.client.asset import Batch from pyatlan.model.enums import CertificateStatus from pyatlan.model.fluent_search import CompoundQuery , FluentSearch from pyatlan.model.assets import Asset , View , MaterialisedView LOGGER = logging . getLogger ( __name__ ) client = AtlanClient () schema_qualified_name = \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH\" # (1) batch = Batch ( # (2) client = client , max_size = 20 , replace_atlan_tags = False , custom_metadata_handling = CustomMetadataHandling .

Create a batch of assets to accumulate changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself. The Batch() takes the following parameters: client : an instance of AssetClient . max_size : the maximum size of each batch to be processed (per API call). Additional optional parameters By default (using only the options above) no classifications or custom metadata will be added or changed on the assets in each batch. To also include classifications and custom metadata, you need to use these additional parameters: replace_atlan_tags ( default: False ): If True replace all classifications (tags) on the assets in the batch, which would include removing classifications (tags) if none are provided for the assets in the batch itself (or False if you still want to ignore classifications) custom_metadata_handling ( default: CustomMetadataHandling.IGNORE ): control how custom metadata should be handled for the assets: IGNORE any custom metadata changes in the batch, OVERWRITE to replace all custom metadata with what's provided in the batch (including removing custom metadata that already exists on an asset), or MERGE to only add or update custom metadata based on what's in the batch (leaving other existing custom metadata unchanged) capture_failures ( default: False ): control whether failures should be captured across batches ( True ) or ignored ( False ) update_only ( default: False ): control whether the batch should only attempt to update assets that already exist ( True ) or also create assets if they do not yet exist ( False ) track ( default: False ): control whether details about each created and updated asset across batches should be tracked ( True ) or ignored ( False ) — counts will always be kept case_insensitive ( default: False ): control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done in a case-insensitive way ( True ) or case-sensitively ( False ) creation_handling ( default: AssetCreationHandling.FULL ): control what kind of assets to create, if not running in update_only mode; PARTIAL assets (only available in lineage), or FULL assets table_view_agnostic ( default: False ): control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done strictly according to the data type specified ( False ), or if tables, views and materialized views should be treated interchangeably ( True ) You can then start defining a pipeline directly using a FluentSearch() object. You can chain as many where() methods as you want to define all the conditions the search results must match. You can use the class variables within any given type to select a particular attribute (like QUALIFIED_NAME in this example), and then limit results to only those assets whose qualified_name starts with the qualified_name of the schema (by using the startswith() predicate). In this example, that means only assets that are within this particular schema will be returned as results. Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use the CompoundQuery.asset_types() helper method to restrict results to only views and materialized views. Since you only want to update views that do not already have a certificate, you can further limit the results using the where_not() method. This will exclude any assets where a certificate already has_any_value() . (Optional) You can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page. Add as many attributes as needed. Each attribute you add here will ensure that detail is included in each search result. So in this example, every view will include its description, certificate, and individual owners. (Limit these attributes to the minimum you need about each view to do your intended work.) You can translate the object you've built up into various outputs, for example immediately calculating a count of how many results match or streaming them directly for processing. In this case, the toRequest() method will give us the resulting set of criteria back as a complete index search request. You can then execute the search based on the request.tore all of those details back into a response object. For each result, you can then carry out your changes and submit them into the batch. Every asset implements the trim_to_required() method, which gives you a builder containing only the bare minimum information needed to update that asset. Limit your asset to only what you intend to update When you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request — leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan. By using trim_to_required() you can remove all information you do not want to update, and then chain on only the details you do want to update. In this running example, you are updating the certificate to verified and setting a new owner — so you simply set those updates on the trimmed object. You can then add your (in-memory) modified asset to the batch. The Batch 's add() method used in the previous step will automatically save as its internal queue of assets reaches a full batch size. Remember to flush However, since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up. Example: pipelining 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 val schemaQN = \"default/snowflake/1662194632/MYDB/MY_SCH\" // (1) ParallelBatch ( client , 20 ). use { batch -> // (2) client . assets . select () // (3) . where ( Asset . QUALIFIED_NAME . startsWith ( schemaQN )) // (4) . where ( Asset . TYPE_NAME . `in` ( listOf ( View . TYPE_NAME , MaterializedView . TYPE_NAME ))) // (5) . whereNot ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS . hasAnyValue ()) // (6) . pageSize ( 100 ) // (7) . includeOnResults ( Asset . DESCRIPTION ) // (8) . includeOnResults ( Asset . CERTIFICATE_STATUS ) . includeOnResults ( Asset . OWNER_USERS ) . stream ( true ) // (9) . forEach ( result -> { // (10) try { batch . add ( result . trimToRequired () // (11) . certificateStatus ( CertificateStatus . VERIFIED ) // (12) . ownerUser ( \"jsmith\" ) . build ()) // (13) } catch ( AtlanException e ) { // (14) log . error ( \"Unable to update: {}\" , result . qualifiedName ); } }); batch . flush () // (15) log . info ( \"Created: {}\" , batch . created . size ) log . info ( \"Updated: {}\" , batch . updated . size ) } The qualifiedName of every view starts with the qualifiedName of its parent (schema), so we can limit the results to a particular schema by using the qualifiedName . Create a batch of assets to build-up the changes across multiple assets before applying those changes in Atlan itself. When parallel-processing (see further notes on the stream(true) ) you need to use a parallel-capable ParallelBatch : The first parameter defines the Atlan tenant on which the batch will be processed The second specifies the maximum number of assets to build-up before sending them across to Atlan Additional parameters By default (using only the options above) no classifications or custom metadata will be added or changed on the assets in each batch. To also include classifications and custom metadata, you need to use these additional parameters: A third parameter of true to replace all classifications on the assets in the batch, which would include removing classifications if none are provided for the assets in the batch itself (or false if you still want to ignore classifications) A fourth parameter to control how custom metadata should be handled for the assets: IGNORE any custom metadata changes in the batch, OVERWRITE to replace all custom metadata with what's provided in the batch (including removing custom metadata that already exists on an asset), or MERGE to only add or update custom metadata based on what's in the batch (leaving other existing custom metadata unchanged) a fifth parameter to control whether failures should be captured across batches ( true ) or ignored ( false ) a sixth parameter to control whether the batch should only attempt to update assets that already exist ( true ) or also create assets if they do not yet exist ( false ) a seventh parameter to control whether details about each created and updated asset across batches should be tracked ( true ) or ignored ( false ) — counts will always be kept an eighth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done in a case-insensitive way ( true ) or case-sensitively ( false ) a ninth parameter to control what kind of assets to create, if not running in updateOnly mode: partial assets (only available in lineage), or full assets a tenth parameter to control whether the matching for determining whether an asset already exists should be done strictly according to the data type specified ( false ), or if tables, views and materialized views should be treated interchangeably ( true ) You can then start defining a pipeline directly against the client's assets by using the select() method. Including archived (soft-deleted) assets Searches by default will return all assets that are found — whether active or archived (soft-deleted). In most cases, you probably only want the active ones, so this is the default behavior of select() . Sending in true to this select() method will start the pipeline to include any archived (soft-deleted) assets in the results, if you do want them. You can chain as many where() methods as you want to define all the conditions the search results must match. You can use the static constants within any given type to select a particular attribute (like QUALIFIED_NAME in this example), and then limit results to only those assets whose qualifiedName starts with the qualifiedName of the schema (by using the startsWith() predicate). In this example, that means only assets that are within this particular schema will be returned as results. Since there could be tables, views, materialized views and columns in this schema — but you only want views and materialized views — you can use the Asset.TYPE_NAME.in helper method to restrict results to only views and materialized views. Since you only want to update views that do not already have a certificate, you can further limit the results using the whereNot() method. This will exclude any assets where a certificate already hasAnyValue() . (Optional) You can play around with different page sizes, to further limit API calls by retrieving more results per page. Add as many attributes as needed. Each attribute you add here will ensure that detail is included in each search result. So in this example, every view will include its description, certificate, and individual owners. (Limit these attributes to the minimum you need about each view to do your intended work.) Once you have defined the criteria for your pipeline, call the stream() method to push-down the pipeline to Atlan. This will: Create a search that combines all the criteria you have specified. Run that search against Atlan to produce the first page of results. Page through the results by lazily fetching each subsequent page as you iterate through them. (So if you use a limit() on the stream, for example, you can break out before retrieving all pages.) Can also run in parallel threads You can also parallel-stream the results by passing true to the stream() method. This will spawn multiple threads that each independently process a page of results and combine the results in parallel. While this can be significantly faster for processing many results, keep in mind if you are collecting the results into any structure that structure must be thread-safe. (For example, you'll need to use things like ConcurrentHashMap rather than just HashMap , and to use ParallelBatch rather than AssetBatch if making changes.) For each result, you can then carry out your changes and submit them into the batch. Every asset implements the trimToRequired() method, which gives you a builder containing only the bare minimum information needed to update that asset. Limit your asset to only what you intend to update When you send an update to Atlan, it will only attempt to change the information you send in your request — leaving any information not in your request as-is (unchanged) on the asset in Atlan. By using trimToRequired() you can remove all information you do not want to update, and then chain on only the details you do want to update. In this running example, you are updating the certificate to verified and setting a new owner — so you simply chain those updates onto the trimmed builder. You can then add your (in-memory) modified asset to the batch. Auto-saves as it goes As long as the number of assets built-up is below the maximum batch size specified when creating the batch, this will simply continue to build up the batch. As soon as you hit the size limit for the batch, though, this same method will call the save() operation to batch-update all of those assets in a single API call. Remember to flush Since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up, when the size of the queue did not yet reach the full batch size. Both the .add() and .flush() operations of the AssetBatch could send a request over to Atlan. Either can therefore also run into trouble and raise an error through an AtlanException .

Remember to flush However, since your loop could finish before you reach another full batch, you must always remember to flush() the batch. This will send any remaining assets that were queued up. Requires numerous API calls To implement the same logic purely through raw API calls will require making many calls: To run the search. To page through the results. To batch up a set of assets to update. To submit each batch of assets to update. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

Access policies Atlan creates the policies that grant access to a connection, including the ability to retrieve the connection and to create assets within it, asynchronously. It can take several seconds (even up to approximately 30 seconds) before these are in place after creating the connection. You may therefore need to wait before you'll be able to create the assets below within the connection. To confirm access, retrieve the connection after it has been created. The SDKs' retry loops will automatically retry until the connection can be successfully retrieved. At that point, your API token has permission to create the other assets. Note: if you are reusing an existing connection rather than creating one via your API token, you must give your API token a persona that has access to that connection. Otherwise all attempts to create, read, update, or delete assets within that connection will fail due to a lack of permissions. DocumentDBDatabase ¶ 6.0.3 5.0.6 A DocumentDB database requires a name and a qualifiedName . For creation, you also need to specify the connectionQualifiedName of the connection for the database.

Optionally include additional metadata about the database. DocumentDBCollection ¶ 6.0.3 5.0.6 A DocumentDB collection requires a name and a qualifiedName .

Human-readable name for your collection. The qualifiedName should follow the pattern: default/documentdb/<epoch>/<database_name>/<collection_name> , where default/documentdb/<epoch>/<database_name> is the qualifiedName of the database that contains this collection.

The connectorName must be the same value as the connector type used when creating the connection. Optionally provide the schema definition for the collection. Optionally specify whether the collection is capped or not. Optionally provide additional metadata about the collection. Additional collection properties ¶ The DocumentDBCollection asset type has a number of specific properties that you can use to provide more detailed information: documentDBCollectionAverageObjectSize : Average size of an object in the collection documentDBCollectionExpireAfterSeconds : Seconds after which documents in a time series collection or clustered collection expire documentDBCollectionMaxSize : Maximum size allowed in a capped collection documentDBCollectionMaximumDocumentCount : Maximum number of documents allowed in a capped collection documentDBCollectionNumOrphanDocs : Number of orphaned documents in the collection documentDBCollectionSubtype : Subtype of a DocumentDB collection (e.g., Capped, Time Series, etc.) documentDBCollectionTimeField : Name of the field containing the date in each time series document documentDBCollectionTimeGranularity : Closest match to the time span between consecutive incoming measurements documentDBCollectionTotalIndexSize : Total size of all indexes Available relationships ¶ Each DocumentDB asset is an Asset , and can therefore be related to the following other assets. erDiagram Asset }o--o{ AtlasGlossaryTerm : meanings Asset ||--o{ Link : links Asset ||--o| Readme : readme Asset }o--o{ Process : inputToProcesses Asset }o--o{ Process : outputFromProcesses AtlasGlossaryTerm ¶ A glossary term provides meaning to an asset. The link terms to assets snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Link ¶ A link provides additional context to an asset, by providing a URL to additional information. Readme ¶ A README provides rich documentation for an asset. The add asset READMEs snippet provides more detail on setting this relationship. Process ¶ A process provides lineage information for an asset. An asset can be both an input and an output for one or more processes. The lineage snippets provide more detail on creating and working with lineage. Note that unlike other assets, the packaged connection delete utility in the UI will not remove DocumentDB assets associated with the connection. So the DocumentDB assets themselves must be deleted, separately from the connection. ↩ Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

    "title": "Set up Amazon DynamoDB | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page warning 🤓 Who can do this? You will probably need your Amazon DynamoDB administrator to run these commands - you may not have access yourself. Atlan supports the following authentication methods for fetching metadata from Amazon DynamoDB: IAM user authentication - this method uses an AWS access key, secret key, and region to fetch metadata. IAM role authentication - this method uses an AWS role ARN and region to fetch metadata. Create IAM policy ​ To create an IAM policy with the necessary permissions, follow the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . Create the policy using the following JSON: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"dynamodb:ListTables\" ] , \"Resource\" : \"*\" } , { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Action\" : [ \"dynamodb:DescribeTable\" ] , \"Resource\" : \"arn:aws:dynamodb:<region>:<account_id>:table/*\" } ] } Replace <region> with the AWS region of your Amazon DynamoDB instance. Replace <account_id> with your AWS account ID. IAM permissions ​ Atlan requires the following permissions: dynamodb:ListTables : Fetches a list of your Amazon DynamoDB tables. This permission is used during the metadata extraction process to dynamically determine a list of tables. Note that this action does not support resource-level permissions and requires you to choose all resources, hence * for Resource . dynamodb:DescribeTable : Fetches metadata for extracted tables. This action supports resource-level permissions, so for Resource , you can either: Grant permission to all tables in the region for which you want to extract metadata: arn:aws:dynamodb:<region>:<account_id>:table/* Specify the table names for which you want to extract metadata: arn:aws:dynamodb:<region>:<account_id>:table/table_name_1 , arn:aws:dynamodb:<region>:<account_id>:table/table_name_2 Choose authentication mechanism ​ Using the policy created above , configure one of the following options for authentication. User-based authentication ​ To configure IAM user-based authentication: Create an AWS IAM user by following the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . On the Set permissions page, attach the policy created in the previous step to this user. Refer to managing access keys for IAM users to create an access key for the new user. Once the user is created, view or download the user's access key ID and secret access key . danger This will be your only opportunity to view or download the access keys. You will not have access to them again after leaving the user creation screen. Role delegation-based authentication ​ To configure role delegation-based authentication: Raise a support ticket to get the ARN of the Node Instance Role for your Atlan EKS cluster. Create a new role in your AWS account by following the steps in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide . When prompted for policies, attach the policy created in the previous step to this role. When prompted, create a trust relationship for the role using the following trust policy. (Replace <atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn> with the ARN received from Atlan support.) { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"<atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn>\" } , \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" , \"Condition\" : { } } ] } (Optional) To use an external ID for additional security, paste the external ID into the policy: { \"Version\" : \"2012-10-17\" , \"Statement\" : [ { \"Effect\" : \"Allow\" , \"Principal\" : { \"AWS\" : \"<atlan_nodeinstance_role_arn>\" } , \"Action\" : \"sts:AssumeRole\" , \"Condition\" : { \"StringEquals\" : { \"sts:ExternalId\" : \"<atlan_external_id>\" } } } ] } Replace <atlan_external_id> with the external ID you want to use. Now, reach out to Atlan support with: The name of the role you created above. The ID of the AWS account where the role was created. danger Wait until the support team confirms the account is allowlisted to assume the role before running the crawler.

    "content": "On this page Eliminate the need for separate crawler configurations by using a single service principal to crawl metadata from all workspaces within a Databricks metastore. This guide walks you through configuring the necessary permissions to enable cross-workspace extraction. Important! Cross-workspace extraction isn't supported for REST API or JDBC extraction methods. Prerequisites ​ Before you begin, make sure you have: A Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace Account admin access to create and manage service principals Workspace admin access to grant permissions across all target workspaces At least one active SQL warehouse in each workspace you intend to crawl Set up Databricks authentication completed with one of the supported authentication methods System table extraction enabled for lineage and usage extraction Add service principal to all workspaces ​ You must use a single, common service principal that has been granted access to all Databricks workspaces you intend to crawl within the metastore. Log in to your Databricks account console as an account admin From the left menu, click Workspaces and select a workspace From the tabs along the top, click the Permissions tab In the upper right, click Add permissions In the Add permissions dialog: For User, group, or service principal , select your service principal For Permission , select workspace User Click Add Repeat steps 2-5 for each workspace you intend to crawl Permissions required ​ The service principal needs the following permissions on each workspace from which the you want Atlan to extract metadata and to enable cross-workspace extraction: CAN_USE on SQL warehouses in each workspace USE CATALOG on system catalog USE SCHEMA on system.access (for cross-workspace discovery) USE SCHEMA on system.information_schema SELECT on the following system tables: system.access.workspace_latest (for cross-workspace discovery) system.information_schema.catalogs system.information_schema.schemata system.information_schema.tables system.information_schema.columns system.information_schema.key_column_usage system.information_schema.table_constraints BROWSE on all catalogs you want to crawl Grant permissions ​ Configure the necessary permissions for the service principal to access and extract metadata from all workspaces within the metastore. SQL workspace permissions: The service principal must have usage permissions on at least one active SQL warehouse within each workspace . The extractor uses the smallest available warehouse to run its discovery queries. Via SQL Via UI Connect to your Databricks workspace using a SQL client or the SQL editor Run the following command for each workspace, replacing the placeholders: GRANT CAN_USE ON WAREHOUSE < warehouse_name > TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; Replace <warehouse_name> with your actual warehouse name Replace <service_principal_id> with your service principal's application ID Example GRANT CAN_USE ON WAREHOUSE production - warehouse TO ` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ` ; Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin From the left menu, click SQL Warehouses On the Compute page, for each SQL warehouse, click the 3-dot icon and then click Permissions In the Manage permissions dialog: In the Type to add multiple users or groups field, search for and select your service principal Select Can use permission Click Add to assign the permission System table permissions: Access to the system schema is essential for workspace and lineage discovery. Via SQL Via UI Connect to your Databricks workspace using a SQL client or the SQL editor Grant system catalog access: GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG system TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; Grant schema-level permissions: GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system . access TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system . information_schema TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; Grant SELECT permissions on required system tables: -- For cross-workspace discovery GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . access . workspace_latest TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; -- For metadata extraction GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . information_schema . catalogs TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . information_schema . schemata TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . information_schema . tables TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . information_schema . columns TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . information_schema . key_column_usage TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . information_schema . table_constraints TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; Replace <service_principal_id> with your service principal's application ID Example GRANT USE CATALOG ON CATALOG system TO ` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ` ; GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system . access TO ` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ` ; GRANT USE SCHEMA ON SCHEMA system . information_schema TO ` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ` ; GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . access . workspace_latest TO ` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ` ; GRANT SELECT ON TABLE system . information_schema . catalogs TO ` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ` ; Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin From the left menu, click Catalog In the Catalog Explorer , click on the system catalog Click the Permissions tab and then click Grant In the Grant permissions dialog: Under Principals , select your service principal Under Privileges , check USE CATALOG Click Grant to apply the permissions Navigate to system > access Click the Permissions tab and then click Grant In the Grant permissions dialog: Under Principals , select your service principal Under Privileges , check USE SCHEMA Click Grant Repeat for system > information_schema For each required system table, navigate to the table and grant SELECT permissions: system.access.workspace_latest system.information_schema.catalogs system.information_schema.schemata system.information_schema.tables system.information_schema.columns system.information_schema.key_column_usage system.information_schema.table_constraints Asset permissions: The service principal requires BROWSE permissions on all catalogs you want to crawl. BROWSE permission enables the service principal to see and read metadata for all data assets within the catalog, automatically granting access to all schemas and tables. Important! For private catalogs, grant permissions from each workspace. For public catalogs, grant from any workspace. Only visible in the system tables when the service principal has BROWSE privileges on individual catalogs. Via SQL Via UI Connect to your Databricks workspace using a SQL client or the SQL editor Grant BROWSE permissions on each catalog you want to crawl: GRANT BROWSE ON CATALOG < catalog_name > TO ` <service_principal_id> ` ; Replace <catalog_name> with your actual catalog name Replace <service_principal_id> with your service principal's application ID Example GRANT BROWSE ON CATALOG main TO ` 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ` ; Log in to your Databricks workspace as a workspace admin From the left menu, click Catalog In the Catalog Explorer , navigate to the catalog you want to grant permissions on (for example, main ) Click the Permissions tab and then click Grant In the Grant permissions dialog: Under Principals , select your service principal Under Privileges , check BROWSE Click Grant to apply the permissions Repeat steps 3-5 for each catalog you want to crawl in Atlan Need help? ​ Check Cross-workspace extraction setup FAQ for common questions about cross-workspace extraction Check Troubleshooting cross-workspace extraction issues for common issues Contact Atlan support for help with setup or integration Next steps ​ Crawl Databricks - Set up and run a workflow to extract metadata from your Databricks instance using direct, offline, or agent extraction methods Prerequisites Add service principal to all workspaces Permissions required Grant permissions Need help?

    "title": "extract on-premises Databricks lineage | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page Once you have set up the databricks-extractor tool , you can extract lineage from your on-premises Databricks instances by completing the following steps. Run databricks-extractor ​ To extract lineage for a specific Databricks connection using the databricks-extractor tool: Log into the server with Docker Compose installed. Change to the directory containing the compose file. Run Docker Compose: sudo docker-compose up <connection-name> (Replace <connection-name> with the name of the connection from the services section of the compose file.) (Optional) Review generated files ​ The databricks-extractor tool will generate many folders with JSON files for each service . For example: extracted-lineage extracted-query-history (if EXTRACT_QUERY_HISTORY is set to true) You can inspect the lineage and usage metadata and make sure it is acceptable for providing metadata to Atlan. Upload generated files to S3 ​ To provide Atlan access to the extracted lineage and usage metadata, you will need to upload the metadata to an S3 bucket. Did you know? We recommend uploading to the same S3 bucket as Atlan uses to avoid access issues. Reach out to your Data Success Manager to get the details of your Atlan bucket. To create your own bucket, refer to the Create your own S3 bucket section of the dbt documentation. (The steps will be exactly the same.) To upload the metadata to S3: Ensure that all files for a particular connection have the same prefix. For example, output/databricks-lineage-example/extracted-lineage/result-0.json , output/databricks-lineage-example/extracted-query-history/result-0.json , and so on. Upload the files to the S3 bucket using your preferred method. For example, to upload all files using the AWS CLI : aws s3 cp output/databricks-lineage-example s3://my-bucket/metadata/databricks-lineage-example --recursive Extract lineage in Atlan ​ Once you have extracted lineage on-premises and uploaded the results to S3, you can extract lineage in Atlan: How to extract lineage and usage from Databricks Be sure to select Offline for the Extraction method .

    "content": "On this page Who can do this? You will need your Sisense administrator to complete these steps - you may not have access yourself. Atlan supports the basic authentication method for fetching metadata from Sisense. This method uses a username and password to fetch metadata. Note that the Sisense connector does not support Sisense for Cloud Data Teams, formerly Periscope Data. Create new user in Sisense ​ Did you know? Atlan does not make any API requests or queries that will update the objects in your Sisense environment. You will need to create a new user in your Sisense instance and assign the Data Admin role to the new user for integrating with Atlan. While Atlan can crawl all other Sisense asset types with the Viewer role, the Data Admin role is required to crawl and generate lineage for data model tables . Atlan uses the Datamodels API to crawl data models and data model tables from Sisense. The Viewer role does not provide access to data models. To create a new user for crawling Sisense : Log in to your Sisense instance with the Admin role. From the tabs along the top, click Admin . On the Admin page, in the System Management box, click Users . From the top right of the Users page, click + Users to add a new user. In the Add Users dialog, enter the following details: For Email , enter an email address for the new user - this will be the username for authenticating the connection in Atlan . (Optional) For First Name and Last Name , enter a first and last name for the new user - for example, Atlan_integration . For Role , click the role dropdown and then click Data Admin to assign that role to the new user. Toggle on Define Password , and for Set Password , set a password for the new user. Confirm the password in the next step. Click Save to complete new user creation. Create new user in Sisense",

Specify a human-readable name for your query. Since we're creating a query for a Snowflake schema. Provide the qualifiedName of the Snowflake connection. Specify the raw SQL query. Provide the qualifiedName of the Snowflake schema. Provide the qualifiedName of the Snowflake database. In this example, we're creating a folder inside an existing collection; therefore, we specify the qualifiedName of the collection here. If you're creating a sub-folder, you should provide the qualifiedName of the parent folder. Specify the qualifiedName of the collection. Since this is a non-visual query, ensure it is appropriately marked as such. In this example, we're creating a query inside an existing folder; therefore, we specify the qualifiedName of the folder here. If you're creating a query inside a collection, you should provide the qualifiedName of the collection. Although if you want to delete everything in a connection, your better avenue is the packaged connection delete utility in the UI. ↩ Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

    "title": "Troubleshooting on-premises Looker connectivity | Atlan Documentation",
    "content": "On this page How do I disable cloning Looker projects from git? ​ The looker-extractor tool clones your Looker git project to parse field-level lineage. By default, the extractor needs the looker_git_private_key and looker_git_private_key_passphrase secrets. To disable this behavior, you need to set the USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE parameter to \"false\" . For example: services: # Example Looker connection looker-example: <<: *extract environment: <<: *looker-defaults INCLUDE_PROJECTS: \"project-1,project-2\" USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE: \"false\" volumes: - ./output/looker-example:/output/process secrets: - looker_config secrets: looker_config: file: ./looker.ini Note that we refer to only the looker-config secret in this looker-example service. This is possible because the USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE environment variable is set to \"false\" . How do I use different credentials for different connections? ​ You may define as many Looker connections under the services section as you want. As mentioned before, by default each connection requires the following secrets: looker_config looker_git_private_key looker_git_private_key_passphrase You may want to define many connections with different credentials. For example, you may want to extract field-level lineage for some projects and not for others. To do this, you need to define and refer to those secrets separately for each connection. For example: services: # The first-connection uses secrets with default names, # so no need to specify its own `secrets` section first-connection: <<: *extract environment: <<: *looker-defaults INCLUDE_PROJECTS: \"project-1\" USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE: \"true\" volumes: - ./output/first-connection:/output/process # The second-connection uses alternative secrets, # so it defines its own `secrets` section to refer to them second-connection: <<: *extract environment: <<: *looker-defaults INCLUDE_PROJECTS: \"project-2\" USE_FIELD_LEVEL_LINEAGE: \"true\" volumes: - ./output/first-connection:/output/process secrets: - target: looker_config source: alternative_config - target: looker_git_private_key source: alternative_private_key - target: looker_git_private_key_passphrase source: alternative_key_passphrase secrets: # Credentials for the first-connection (default names) looker_config: file: ./looker.ini looker_git_private_key: file: ./id_rsa looker_git_private_key_passphrase: file: ./passphrase.txt # Credentials for the second-connection alternative_config: file: ./path/to/alternative/looker.ini alternative_private_key: file: ./path/to/alternative/id_rsa alternative_key_passphrase: file: ./path/to/alternative/passphrase.txt In the second-connection secrets list, note that: the target attribute gives the default name of the secret the extractor expects the source attribute gives the alternative secret name",

This approach separates warehouse performance from other workloads, enables precise cost tracking for Atlan operations, and provides consistent workflow performance. One warehouse per connection : Provision one Snowflake warehouse for each Atlan connection to maintain scoped capacity and predictable resource allocation. Configure statement timeout ​ Set appropriate timeout values : If your account enforces timeouts, configure both STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS and STATEMENT_QUEUED_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS to at least 6 hours (21,600 seconds) for the Atlan user to accommodate comprehensive data cataloging workflows. Default values work well : By default, both parameters are set to 0 (no limit), which is optimal for Atlan operations. Only adjust if your organization requires specific timeout enforcement. Apply at user level : Configure timeouts at the user level for consistent behavior across all Atlan sessions rather than at warehouse or session level.
